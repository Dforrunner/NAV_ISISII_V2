<ul>

    <li>If you get an 'X' in the upper left corner of the box, or have never been in this part of ISIS before, click

    </li>
</ul>

<p align="center">If ActiveCGM has previously been loaded on this PC, you may need to uninstall it before doing the
    reload.
    <br>Go to a Command (DOS) prompt.
    <br>Go to the main windows drive. Type "c:" if you are not already at the "c" prompt.
    <br>Change directories to the Windows directory. It probably is "cd winnt". For Windows 95/98 it may be "cd
    windows/system"
    <br>Type "regsvr32 /u acgm.dll"
    <br>Wait a couple of seconds and you should get a message that the control was unregistered.
<p align="center">Then...
<p align="center"><a href="reload2.htm">Download this control (version 7.1 SP02) for all Windows operating systems
    now.</a>
<p align="center">You may get the following message(s) when loading the control.</p>
<p align="center"><img HEIGHT="321" WIDTH="441" src="../images/activecgm1.gif"><br>Click <u>Y</u>es to load the control.
<p align="center"><img HEIGHT="119" WIDTH="342" src="../images/activecgm2.gif"><br>Click <u>Y</u>es if you would like to
    be able to view TIF files by double-clicking on them in a directory list. ISIS doesn't depend on this choice.
