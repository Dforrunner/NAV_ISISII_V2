        <title>LUBRICATION</title>
        <para>All BX-2150 compressors are connected to the engine's pressurized oil system and a continuous flow of oil
            is provided to the compressor, which is eventually returned to the engine.
        </para>
        <para>Oil is fed into the compressor in various ways, for example: through the rear end cover or the drive end
            of the crankshaft. An oil passage in the crankshaft conducts pressurized oil to the precision sleeve main
            bearings and to the connecting rod bearing.
        </para>
        <para>The cylinder bore, connecting rod wrist pin bushing and ball type main bearing, where used, are splash
            lubricated. Splash lubrication is obtained as oil is forced out around the crankshaft journals by engine oil
            pressure.
