            <title>SS 296 AND QE COMPRESSOR</title>
            <para>The SS 296 and QE air compressors are engine-driven, piston-type compressors which supply compressed
                air to operate air powered devices. The compressor "runs" continuously while the engine is operating,
                but has "loaded" and "unloaded" operating modes. The operating mode is controlled by a
                pressure-activated governor and the compressor unloading assembly. When the air system reaches "cut-out"
                pressure, the governor applies wet tank pressure to the air compressor unloader assembly causing the
                unloader valve to activate, stopping compressed air from being pumped into the air system.
            </para>
            <para>As the air in the air system is used, pressure drops. At "cut-in" pressure, the governor exhausts the
                air signal to the compressor unloader assembly causing the compressor to again pump compressed air into
                the air system.
