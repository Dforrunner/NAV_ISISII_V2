                <para>A spring brake contains a very powerful compression spring. Failure to comply with all of the
                    following instructions may result in forceful release of the double diaphragm Anchorlok spring
                    chamber and its contents which could cause death, severe personal injury and/or property damage.

                        are no user-serviceable parts inside the spring brake chamber. If you experience damage or
                        failure of the spring brake chamber, remove and discard it as outlined in this service section.
                        Never attempt to disassemble the spring brake chamber as serious personal injury, death and/or
                        property damage could result from accidental sudden release of the powerful compression spring.
