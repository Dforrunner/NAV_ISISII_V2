        <title>Brake Pressure Indicator</title>
        <para>The BRAKE PRESSURE indicator is located in the instrument panel gauge cluster (see
            <hotlnk document="s04048_23.xml" xrefid="f0404820">FIGURE 20</hotlnk>). The indicator lights to indicate
            that the pressure in all or part of the system has dropped below a minimum level (approximately 1550 psi).
            Low pressure detected in half of the system (front or rear circuit only) will be indicated by a solid on
            indicator. Low pressure detected in the full system (both front and rear circuits) will be indicated by a
            flashing indicator. Every time the indicator is lit, the warning buzzer sounds, and a diagnostic code is
            generated by the ECU and stored in memory. Retrieval of the diagnostic codes is explained in Section 5,
            <hotlnk document="s04048_HL04048500.xml" xrefid="hl04048500">DIAGNOSIS AND TROUBLESHOOTING</hotlnk>
            . A bulb check occurs each time the ignition switch is turned to the RUN position. The indicator should turn
            on for about three seconds then turn off.
