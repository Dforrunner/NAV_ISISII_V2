        <title>CRANK SHAFT</title>
        <para>Check the crankshaft threads, keyways, tapered ends and all machined and ground surfaces for wear, scores,
            or damage. Standard crankshaft connecting rod journals are between 1.2500 inches (31.75mm) and 1.249 inches
            (31.72mm) in diameter. lf the crankshaft journals are excessively scored or worn or out of round, the
            crankshaft must be replaced. Main bearing journals must be maintained so the ball bearings are a snug fit or
            so that no more than .004 inch (.10mm) clearance exists between the precision sleeve main bearing and the
            main bearing journals on the crankshaft. In crankshafts fitted with oil seal rings, the oil seal ring groove
            or grooves must not be worn. The ring groove walls must have a good finish and they must be square. Using a
            wire or similar device, check to be sure the oil passages are open through the crankshaft.
