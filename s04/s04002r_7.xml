            <para count="1">With air brake system charged and the drain cock closed, test with soap suds for leakage at
                the drain cock. Also check for leakage through the body by coating the outside of the drain cock with
                soap solution. Leakage in excess of a 3 inch diameter soap bubble in 3 seconds is not serviceable.

            <para count="1">Leakage is caused by dirty or scored key or body. Leakage due to dirt is corrected by
                cleaning parts and lubricating. Lubricate with Fleetrite EP2 Moly grease or equivalent to NLGI #2
                multi-purpose lithium grease. Leakage due to a scored key or body cannot be repaired and the drain cock
                must be replaced.
