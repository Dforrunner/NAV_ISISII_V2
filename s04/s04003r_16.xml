        <svcsubsecinfo>
            <para>Compressor leakage tests need not be performed on a regular basis. These tests should be performed
                when it is suspected that discharge valve leakage is substantially affecting compressor build up
                performance, or when it is suspected that the compressor is "cycling" between the load and unloaded
                modes due to unloader piston leakage.
            </para>
            <para>These tests must be performed with the vehicle parked on a level surface, the engine not running, the
                entire air system completely drained to 0 psi, and the inlet check valve detail parts removed, if
                applicable.

            <title>UNLOADER PISTON LEAKAGE</title>
            <para>The unloader pistons can be checked for leakage as follows: with the cylinder head removed from the
                compressor and the inlet flange securely covered, apply 120 psi of air pressure to the governor port.
                Listen for an escape of air at the inlet valve area. An audible escape of air should not be detected.
