        <title>ANTILOCK BRAKE APPLICATION</title>
        <para>If a service brake application is made and the wheel speed sensors detect an impending wheel lockup, the
            EC-17 controller will immediately begin modification of the brake application using the antilock
            modulator(s) at the affected wheel(s). Solenoid valves contained in the modulator (hold and exhaust) are
            energized and de-energized by the EC-17 controller in order to modify the brake application. When a solenoid
            coil is energized, its shuttle moves. Depending upon the function of the specific solenoid, it either opens
            or closes, thereby causing the exhaust or re- application of air pressure to the brake actuator.
        </para>
        <para>The solenoids in each modulator are controlled independently by the EC-17. By opening and closing the
            solenoid valves in the appropriate modulator, the EC-17 is actually simulating what drivers do when they
            "pump the brakes." It must be remembered however, that unlike the driver, the EC-17 controller is able to
            "pump" each brake on the vehicle independently and with far greater speed and accuracy.
