        <title>INSTALLATION</title>
        <para>Care should be used in selecting the correct thickness of lining for each brake shoe and drum. Usually the
            standard thickness will be used. If the drum has been turned or has become worn, oversize lining may be
            required.
        </para>
        <para>Do not handle new brake linings or relined shoes with greasy hands or allow linings to come in contact
            with mineral oil or grease.
        </para>
        <para>The lining must be installed on the shoe so that it fits smoothly and evenly, contacting the shoe
            throughout the entire radius. If gaps occur between the lining and shoe, difficulty will be met in adjusting
            the brakes in that a "spongy" or rubbery pedal may occur which makes satisfactory brake application
            impossible.
        </para>
        <para>To insure complete contact and avoid gaps between lining and shoe, secure lining to shoe with "C" clamps
            so that rivet or bolt holes are in alignment. Position "C" clamps as close to the holes as possible,
            clamping the lining firmly in place.
