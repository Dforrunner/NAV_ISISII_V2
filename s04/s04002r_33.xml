        <para>As long as the air supply pressure is below 65 to 75 psi, the spring will hold the diaphragm on its seat
            restricting the air flow through the valve.
        </para>
        <para>When the air supply pressure overcomes the spring force, the diaphragm will move off the seat and allow
            air to flow through the valve and to the auxiliary equipment used on the vehicle.
        </para>
        <para>If air pressure should fall approximately 20 psi below the opening pressure, the spring force will
            overcome the air pressure and force the diaphragm on its seat, closing off the air supply, protecting the
            air system from a complete loss of air through usage of the auxiliary equipment.
