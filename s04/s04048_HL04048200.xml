                    <para>The vehicles covered in this manual have used two different electrical controllers. Both
                        controllers are mounted in the same location. The original controller was known as the
                        Electrical System Controller (ESC). The current controller is known as the Body Controller (BC).
                        In this manual the controller will be identified as the Body Controller or the ESC/BC.

            <para>The Full Power Brake System is an electronic wheel speed monitoring and control system used on buses
                equipped with a hydraulic brake system. The following standard features of this system are covered in
                this manual.
