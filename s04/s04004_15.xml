            <para>Compressor leakage tests need not be performed on a regular basis. These tests should be performed
                when it is suspected that discharge valve leakage is substantially affecting compressor build-up
                performance, or when it is suspected that the compressor is "cycling" between the load and unloaded
                modes due to unloader piston leakage.
            </para>
            <para>These tests must be performed with vehicle parked on a level surface, the engine not running, the
                entire air system completely drained to 0 P.S.l (0 kPa), and the inlet check valve detail parts removed.

            <title>UNLOADER PISTON LEAKAGE</title>
            <para>Remove the governor and apply shop air pressure to the 1/8" pipe thread unloader port on the governor
                mounting pad. Listen for the escape of air at the inlet cavity. An audible escape of air should not be
                detected. lf any question exists as to leakage, it is recommended that a genuine International unloader
                kit be installed and the cylinder head retested.
