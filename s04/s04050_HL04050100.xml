                    <para>Anti-lock Brake Systems (ABS) are designed to enhance overall vehicle safety when a vehicle is
                        driven within its normal safety limits. ABS cannot compensate for a vehicle which is being
                        driven beyond the physical limits of control. Drivers operating an ABS equipped vehicle should
                        employ safe driving skills and assume no additional driving risks. Failure to follow this
                        warning could result in property damage, personal injury or death.

                    <para>Do not allow brake fluid to come into contact with eyes or skin. If brake fluid contacts eyes,
                        flush immediately with water for at least fifteen minutes. Clean contaminated skin thoroughly.

                    <para>Failure to bleed the system whenever any hydraulic system fitting is loosened or disconnected
                        will allow air to remain in the system. Air in hydraulic lines will greatly reduce the pressure
                        available for braking. This can increase vehicle stopping distance which could result in
                        property damage, personal injury or death.
                    </para>

                <warning>
                    <para>Do not reuse drained brake fluid. Hydraulic brake fluid that is removed can be contaminated
                        and can cause system damage and/or loss of braking. Failure to follow this warning could result
                        in property damage, personal injury or death. Properly discard hydraulic brake fluid that is
                        removed from the brake system.

                    <para>Use only the type of hydraulic brake fluid specified by the equipment manufacturer. Do not use
                        or mix different types of hydraulic brake fluid. Non-specified hydraulic brake fluids will
                        damage the rubber parts of the brake caliper and can cause system damage and/or, loss of
                        braking. Failure to follow this warning could result in property damage, personal injury or
                        death.

                        the paint. Hydraulic brake fluid may also damage certain non-metal surfaces. Do not let fluid
                        get on brake pads, rotors or disks. Contaminated brake pads could cause reduced braking which
                        could result in property damage, personal injury or death.

                        the HCU and the brake calipers. Failure to correctly bleed the system could cause reduced
                        braking or loss of braking, which may result in property damage, personal injury or death.

                        will remain disabled only until the next ignition cycle. The TOOLBOX screen will indicate when
                        the ATC function is disabled.
