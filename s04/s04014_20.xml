        <title>TESTING FOR LEAKAGE</title>
        <para>Park the vehicle without a trailer on a level surface and block the wheels to prevent movement and then
            release the parking brake. Build up air tanks to air governor cut-out pressure; stop engine; let air
            pressure gauges stabilize for one minute, then time the pressure drop on the gauges. Pressure should not
            drop more than 2 psi per minute. If the gauges do not drop excessively, then the leakage must be from the
            wet tank (not indicated on gauge) up stream of the service tanks. This is most easily checked by separating
            lines at various junctions and applying shop air to the system while feeling and listening for leaks. Soapy
            water and high frequency acoustic detectors may also be helpful.

            information on checking for air leaks for the type of air dryer being serviced. Also refer to
