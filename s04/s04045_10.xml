        <title>HOW HYDRAULIC ABS WORKS</title>
        <para>ABS wheel sensors detect wheel speeds. The sensors generate signals that are transmitted to an Electronic
            Control Unit (ECU). If the wheels start to lock, the ECU signals the modulator assembly to regulate the
            brake pressure of each locking wheel.
        </para>
        <para>During an ABS stop, a solenoid valve in the modulator assembly is rapidly pulsed; that is, it opens and
            closes several times per second to control the brake pressure. When this occurs, drivers may notice a
            pulsation of the brake pedal.
        </para>
        <para>An ABS indicator lamp on the vehicle dash alerts the driver to a possible system fault and provides blink
            code information to diagnose the system.
        </para>
        <para>If the ABS indicator lamp comes on during normal vehicle operation, drivers may complete their trip, but
            are instructed to have their vehicles serviced as soon as possible.
        </para>
        <para>In the unlikely event of an ABS system malfunction, the ABS in the affected wheel will be disabled and
            will return to normal braking. The other sensed wheels will retain their ABS function.
