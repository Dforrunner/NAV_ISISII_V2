        <para>Every 6 months or 50,000 miles (80,000 km), connect a test gauge to the delivery line and observe at what
            pressure the inlet valves close, which is the delivery pressure. If the pressure delivered by the pressure
            limiting valve varies more than plus or minus 5 psi from the pressure setting of the pressure limiting
            valve, the valve should be adjusted. The lock nut should be tightened after each adjustment and locking wire
            seal replaced if used. Every year or every 100,000 miles (160,000 km), perform Operating and Leakage Tests
            as follows.
