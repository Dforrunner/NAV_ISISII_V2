        <title>INITIAL START-UP DESCRIPTION</title>
        <svcprocinfo>
            <para>For a vehicle
                <emph type="bold">without any system defects</emph>, the following information describes "normal
                behavior" during the engine start-up.
            </para>
            <para>The controller will begin start-up diagnostics when the key is turned to the ON position. Applying the
                service brakes while the controller performs its self-test will produce a "chuff" sound as air exhausts
                from the M-22 modulators.
            </para>
        </svcprocinfo>
        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Normal Start-Up</title>
            <para>Each M-22 modulator contains one (1) exhaust solenoid and one (1) hold solenoid. During the start-up
                test, the controller will "fire" or energize each solenoid briefly in a test cycle making a "chuff"
                sound as the air exhausts. The exhaust solenoid will be "fired" for 10 milliseconds, then a pause for
                only a few milliseconds and the hold solenoid will "fire" for 20 milliseconds. The two firing in rapid
                sequence produces a single "chuff" sound. If the solenoids are wired incorrectly, or if only one is
                firing, the sound will be distinctly different. The controller will begin at the right front, then go to
                the left front, then the right rear, and finish the cycle on the left rear. It will then repeat the
                cycle, making two complete cycles. The second cycle is a repeat of the first.
            </para>
            <para>When the engine is started (or key switch turned to ON position), the controller first runs a series
                of modulator tests as described in the preceding paragraph. The controller begins at the right front
                M-22 modulator and fires each of the (2) solenoids contained in the modulator, then moves to the left
                front modulator and fires each of the (2) solenoids in that modulator and moves to the right rear
                modulator, again firing both solenoids, and finally moves to the left rear and fires each of the (2)
                solenoids in that modulator. The cycle will be repeated one more time, in the same sequence.
            </para>
            <para>After the modulator test is complete, then the yellow instrument panel ABS warning light will flash
                twice, then the warning light will "go out." Once the vehicle is driven 7-10 mph the light may come back
                on if a wheel speed sensor problem is detected.
            </para>
            <para>The Traction Active Light will turn ON briefly as a bulb test during the start-up test, then turn OFF.
                During normal operation this light will only turn ON while the controller is actively working to reduce
                a wheel slip condition during acceleration.
            </para>
            <para>This behavior indicates the antilock system is performing correctly. The controller will continue to
                monitor system performance and illuminate the warning light if a problem is detected.

            <para>If the system is started and the instrument panel ABS warning light does not perform as described
                above, a system fault is present. The ABS yellow warning light:
