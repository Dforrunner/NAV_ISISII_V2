                <para>Anti-lock Brake Systems (ABS) are designed to enhance overall vehicle safety when a vehicle is
                    driven within its normal safety limits. ABS cannot compensate for a vehicle which is being driven
                    beyond the physical limits of control. Drivers operating an ABS equipped vehicle should employ safe
                    driving skills and assume no additional driving risks. Failure to follow this warning could result
                    in property damage, personal injury or death.

        <para>This ABS system is designed to provide the optimum balance between stopping distance and vehicle stability
            during hard braking maneuvers, or when stopping on wet or slippery surfaces. The system accomplishes this
            task by monitoring wheel rotation. The ABS function is controlled by the software in the ABS electronic
            control unit (ECU) and solenoid valves located in the Hydraulic Compact Unit (HCU). The wheel speed
            information is generated by the sensors mounted at each wheel end. The ECU monitors the wheel speed signals.
            When the ECU identifies a wheel that is about to lock, it signals the solenoid valves in the HCU to modulate
            the brake fluid pressure to that wheel, allowing the wheel to "recover". During an ABS event, the solenoid
            valves in the HCU are pulsed; that is, they open and close to control the brake pressure at the wheel end.
            When this occurs, drivers may notice a slight pulsation of the brake pedal.
        </para>
        <para>In the event of an ABS malfunction, a warning lamp will illuminate and diagnostic codes identifying the
            source of the ABS malfunction will be stored in the ECU memory. Retrieval of the diagnostic codes is
            explained in Section 5,

            . During an ABS system malfunction, the ABS function may remain partially operational. The level of ABS
            functionality during a malfunction depends on the type and location of the malfunction. Refer to Section 5,
