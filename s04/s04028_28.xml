        <title>DIAGNOSTIC LEDS</title>
        <para>There are ten LEDs plus a magnetically actuated reset switch in the controller diagnostic display. The
            first six LEDs locate the defective condition to a specific area of the vehicle, while the next three
            indicate the problem component (or its wiring). The LEDs are software driven and either ON or OFF, depending
            upon their monitor function. The ten LEDs are as follows:

        <para>* This LED is not used for diagnostic purposes. It will, however, light when a magnet is placed on the

        </para>
        <para>
            <title>"FRT" (Front) LED</title>
            This Red LED illuminates and latches ON to indicate the location of a problem component or its wiring. It
            will be illuminated at the same time as
            <emph type="bold">either</emph>
            the RIGHT or LEFT LEDs
            <emph type="bold">and either</emph>
            the MOD or SEN LED.
        </para>
        <para>
            <title>"MID" (Mid Axle) LED</title>
            Only 6x4 vehicles with traction control feature and wheel sensors on all four rear axle wheel ends will use
            this LED. Standard installations will not include wheel sensors on all four rear wheel ends. On 6x4 vehicles
            with traction control, the Red LED illuminates and latches ON to indicate the location of a problem with a
            speed sensor or speed sensor wiring. The
            <emph type="bold">MID LED</emph>
            should not illuminate at the same time as the
            <emph type="bold">MOD LED</emph>.
        </para>
        <para>
            <title>"RER" (Rear) LED</title>
            This Red LED illuminates and latches ON to indicate the location of a problem component or its wiring. It
            will be illuminated at the same time as either the RHT or LFT LED and either the MOD or SEN LED.
        </para>
        <para>
            <title>"RHT" (Right) LED</title>
            This Red LED illuminates and latches ON to indicate the location of a problem component or its wiring. It
            will be illuminated at the same time as either the FRT or RER LED and either the MOD or SEN LED.
        </para>
        <para>
            <title>"LFT" (Left) LED</title>
            This Red LED illuminates and latches ON to indicate the location of a problem component or its wiring. It
            will be illuminated at the same time as either the FRT or RER LED and either the MOD or SEN LED.
        </para>
        <para>
            <title>"TRC" (Traction) LED</title>
            This Red LED illuminates and latches ON indicating a permanent or intermittent problem in the traction
            control system. It may be illuminated with the MOD LED or by itself.
        </para>
        <para>
            <title>"MOD" (Modulator) LED</title>
            This Red LED illuminates and latches ON to indicate a permanent or intermittent short or open circuit in one
            of the M-21 modulator valve solenoids or wiring to the solenoids from the controller. There are four M-21
            modulator valves, each having two solenoids. This LED should be illuminated at the same time as either the
            RHT or LFT LED, and either the FRT or RER LED.
        </para>
        <para>
            <title>"SEN" (Speed Sensor) LED</title>
            This Red LED illuminates and latches ON indicating permanent or intermittent failure. The failures that are
            indicated are:

        </seqlist>
        <para>The
            <emph type="bold">SEN</emph>
            LED will be illuminated at the same time as either the RHT or LFT LED and either the FRT, MID or RER LED.
        </para>
        <para>
            <title>"ECU" (Electronic Control Unit) LED</title>
            This Red LED illuminates to indicate that the controller itself has failed. It illuminates and latches ON
            for all controller failures except low voltage. If the controller supply voltage is less than 9 volts DC,
            the LED illuminates to indicate that the controller is inactive. When the supply voltage goes above 9 volts
            DC, the LED will turn OFF.
        </para>
        <para>
            <title>"VLT" (Voltage) LED</title>
            This Green LED illuminates and remains ON during vehicle operation to indicate that vehicle power is
            reaching the controller. If the power supply to the controller from the vehicle electrical system is out of
            range (below 11 volts or above 17 volts) the Green VLT LED will flash until the power supply returns to the
            acceptable voltage range.
        </para>
        <para>
            <title>"RESET"</title>
            Under the RESET area of the LED display is a magnetically sensitive switch used to reset the diagnostic
            system. The device will respond to a magnet sufficient to lift a 3 ounce weight. Holding the magnet against
            the RESET causes all the LEDs to light while the magnet is against the reset.
