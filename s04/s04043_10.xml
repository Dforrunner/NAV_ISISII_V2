        <title>ABS OPERATION</title>
        <svcprocinfo>
            <para>Bendix ABS uses wheel speed sensors, ABS modulators and an ECU to control either four or six wheels.
                By monitoring the wheel slip during braking, and adjusting the brake pressure at each wheel, the EC-30
                is able to optimize slip between the tire and the road surface. When excessive wheel slip is detected,
                the EC-30 controller will activate ABS. The EC-30 controls the ABS modulators to simulate a driver
                pumping the brakes. However, the EC-30 controller is able to pump each brake on the vehicle
                independently, and with greater speed and accuracy than a driver.

            <title>Front Axle Control</title>
            <para>Although both steering-axle wheels are controlled by individual ABS modulators, the EC-30 does not
                control them completely independently. The EC-30 uses an Modified Individual Regulation (MIR) philosophy
                which blends the applied braking force between the two steering axle brakes. MIR is used to minimize
                steering wheel pull while ABS is active on an uneven road surface (e.g., ice and asphalt).

            <title>Single Rear Axle Control</title>
            <para>On vehicles with a single rear axle (4x2), the rear axle wheels are controlled independently.
                Therefore, brake application pressure at each wheel is adjusted according to the wheel behavior on the
                road surface.

            <title>Dual Rear Axle Control</title>
            <para>For vehicles with dual rear axles (6x2 or 6x4), one ABS modulator controls both right wheels and the
                other modulator controls both left wheels. Both wheels on each side receive equal brake pressure during
                an ABS stop. In the case of only four wheel speed sensors, the two rear sensors are located on the
                lighter rear axle.

        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Normal Braking</title>
            <para>During normal braking, brake pressure is delivered through the ABS modulator and into the brake
                actuator. If the wheel speed sensors do not detect an excessive slip, the EC-30 does not activate ABS
                control and the vehicle stops with normal braking.
