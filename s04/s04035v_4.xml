        <para>There are ten LEDs plus a magnetically actuated reset switch in the controller diagnostic display. The
            first six LEDs locate the defective condition to a specific area of the vehicle, while the next three
            indicate the problem component (or its wiring). The LEDs are software driven and either ON or OFF, depending
            upon their monitor function.The ten LEDs are as follows:
