                        system or other electronically controlled components, it is mandatory to remove all connectors
                        going to the Electronic Control Module (ECM). It is also mandatory to disconnect the positive
                        (+) and negative(-) battery cables before connecting the welder. Attach the welder ground cables
                        as close as possible to the part being welded. Never connect the welder ground cables to an ECM
                        or mounting bracket for the ECM.
