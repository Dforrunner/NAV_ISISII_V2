        <svcsubsecinfo>
            <para>This section contains the removal and installation procedures for the components of the brake system.
                After completing any repair or service procedure, use the EZ-TECH
                <supscript>&#174;</supscript>
                and the TOOLBOX&#8482; program to clear all brake system related inactive fault codes. (Codes may be set
                while disconnecting and reconnecting power to the system.) If active faults are indicated after making
                repairs, those faults must be rectified before returning the vehicle to service.
            </para>
            <para>Prior to returning the vehicle to service, make certain all components and systems are restored to
                their proper operating condition. Perform a brief after-service check based on the service performed.
                Check the operation of indicators and exercise any circuits or components that were repaired or
                replaced. A brief test drive should be performed after most repairs.

                <warning>
                    <para>The full power brake system is a pressurized system that achieves pressures of up to 2320 psi.
                        This pressure

                        reduced by switching the ignition off or removing battery power. Prior to servicing this system,
                        the depressurization procedures
                        <emph type="boldundersc">MUST BE PERFORMED EXACTLY AS PRESENTED</emph>. Failure to depressurize
                        the system may result in property damage, personal injury or death.

                <warning>
                    <para>The accumulators MUST NOT be removed until the system has been depressurized as described in
                        the procedures. It is possible for a removed accumulator to retain an internal pressure of up to
                        1087 psi. Before disposing of an accumulator, it must be depressurized and its pressure chamber
                        must be disabled. Failure to follow this warning could result in property damage, personal
                        injury or death.

                        will allow air to remain in the system. Air in hydraulic lines will greatly reduce the pressure
                        available for braking. This can increase vehicle stopping distance which can result in property
                        damage, personal injury or death.

                        in property damage, personal injury or death. Properly discard hydraulic brake fluid that is

                    <para>This is a modern, complex system offering greater braking proficiency and features than

                        professional assistance and repair. However, if location and circumstances prevent consulting
                        the dealer, and components are to be replaced, the prescribed procedure must be followed
                        accurately.

                        Do not let hydraulic brake fluid touch any painted surfaces, as it will remove the paint.
                        Hydraulic brake fluid may also damage certain non-metal surfaces. Do not let fluid get on brake
                        pads, shoes, rotors or disks.
