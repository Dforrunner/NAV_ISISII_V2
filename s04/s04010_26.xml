        <title>TESTING</title>
        <para>To properly test a compressor under operating conditions, a test rack for correct mounting, cooling,
            lubricating and driving the compressor is necessary. Such tests are not compulsory if the unit has been
            carefully rebuilt by an experienced person. A compressor efficiency or build-up test can be run which is not
            too difficult. An engine lubricated compressor must be connected to an oil supply line of at least 15 psi
            during the test and an oil return line must be installed to keep the crankcase drained.
        </para>
        <para>Connect to the compressor discharge port a reservoir with a volume of 1500 cu. in. including the volume of
            connecting line. With the compressor operating at 2100 RPM, the time required to raise the reservoir's
            pressure from 85-100 psi should not exceed 7 seconds. During this test, the compressor should be checked for
            gasket leakage and noisy operation as well as unloader operation and leakage.
