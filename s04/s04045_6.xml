                    <para>The following procedures for servicing brakes are recommended to reduce exposure to asbestos
                        fiber dust, a cancer and lung disease hazard. Material Safety Data Sheets are available from

            <title>Hazard Summary</title>
            <para>Because some brake linings contain asbestos, workers who service brakes must understand the potential
                hazards of asbestos and precautions for reducing risks. Exposure to airborne asbestos dust can cause
                serious and possibly fatal diseases, including asbestosis (a chronic lung disease) and cancer,
                principally lung cancer and mesothelioma (a cancer of the lining of the chest or abdominal cavities).
                Some studies show that the risk of lung cancer among persons who smoke and who are exposed to asbestos
                is much greater than the risk for non-smokers. Symptoms of these diseases may not become apparent for
                15, 20 or more years after the first exposure to asbestos.
            </para>
            <para>Accordingly, workers must use caution to avoid creating and breathing dust when servicing brakes.
                Specific recommended work practices for reducing exposure to asbestos dust follow. Consult your employer
                for more details.

                <para>Whenever feasible, service brakes in a separate area away from other operations to reduce risks to
                    unprotected persons. OSHA has set a maximum allowable level of exposure for asbestos of 0.1 f/cc as
                    an 8-hour time-weighted average and 1.0 f/cc averaged over a 30-minute period. Scientists disagree,
                    however, to what extent adherence to the maximum allowable exposure levels will eliminate the risk
                    of disease that can result from inhaling asbestos dust. OSHA requires that the following sign be
                    posted at the entrance to areas where exposures exceed either of the maximum allowable levels:
