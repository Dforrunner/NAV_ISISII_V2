        <title>INSTALLATION OF ALCOHOL EVAPORATOR KITS</title>
        <para>Installation of alcohol evaporator on vehicles in the field is a common practice and is easily
            accomplished. However, complaints of inoperative alcohol evaporators or excessive use of alcohol can usually
            be traced to either the wrong kit being installed or an incorrect installation of the proper kit. Therefore,
            the selection and installation of the correct kit is important. All field installation kits have
            installation instructions; however, the following information may be helpful.
