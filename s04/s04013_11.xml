        <title>CAGING AND UNCAGING SPRING BRAKE</title>
        <specpara>
            <warning>
                <para>A spring brake contains a very powerful compression spring. Failure to comply with all of the
                    following instructions may result in forceful release of the spring chamber and its contents which
                    could cause death, severe personal injury and/or property damage.
                </para>
            </warning>
        </specpara>
        <para>Refer to GROUP 04 - BRAKES in the CTS-5000 Master Service Manual for the type spring brake being
            serviced.
        </para>
        <para>The power spring of the spring brake can be manually caged by turning the caging bolt clockwise
            approximately 18-21 full turns. DO NOT FORCE THE BOLT BEYOND ITS NORMAL STOP as this will result in
            stripping the threads on the caging bolt inside the chamber. If early design spring brakes are used, first
            remove the caging bolt retainer. DO NOT BEND THE RETAINER BACK.
        </para>
        <specpara>
            <warning>
                <para>Do not attempt to release (cage) the spring brake when the spring brake shows structural damage.
                    Caging the spring may result in the forceful release of the spring chamber and its contents which
                    could cause death, severe personal injury and/or property damage. Remove complete spring brake
                    chamber and replace with new unit.
                </para>
                <para>DISARM the spring chamber before discarding. Failure to disarm assembly prior to disposal may in
                    time result in spontaneous release of the spring chamber and its contents, causing death, personal
                    injury and/or property damage.
                </para>
            </warning>
        </specpara>
        <para>Uncage (release) the spring by reversing the procedure. Some spring brake units employ a non-strippable
            (spring loaded) nut for the uncaged position. It is important that the caging bolt be turned a minimum of 25
            turns counterclockwise to assure a complete release of the power spring. The caging and uncaging operation
            can be made easier by holding 70 psi air pressure through the parking port of the unit to hold the power
            spring. This can be done with the use of the vehicle emergency air system or other available air supply.
