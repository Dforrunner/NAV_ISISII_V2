        <title>CRANKSHAFT</title>
        <para>Check the crankshaft threads, keyways, tapered ends and all machined and ground surfaces for wear, scores,
            or damage. Standard crankshaft journals are 1.1242 in. to 1.1250 in. (28.55468 mm to 28.575 mm) in diameter.
            If the crankshaft journals are excessively scored or worn or out of round and cannot be reground, the
            compressor must be replaced. Connecting rod bearing inserts are available in .010 in. (.254 mm), .020 in.
            (.508 mm) and .030 in. (.762 mm) undersizes for compressors with reground crankshafts. Main bearing journals
            must be maintained so the ball bearings are a snug fit or so that no more than .005 in. (.127 mm) clearance
            exists between the precision sleeve and main bearing and the main bearing journals on the crankshaft. Check
            to be sure the oil passages are open through the crankshaft.
