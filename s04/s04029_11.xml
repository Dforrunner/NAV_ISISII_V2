        <para>The traction active light is located in the right gauge cluster. This light turns ON for a bulb test when
            the key is turned on, then goes out. The light will turn ON during vehicle operation to indicate that the
            traction control system is currently working to reduce wheel slip that the sensors have detected.

        <para>The controller has a ground switch that opens (light OFF) and closes (light ON) the traction active light
