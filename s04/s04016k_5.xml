        <title>WHEEL BEARING ADJUSTMENT</title>
        <para>It is important to the operation of disc brakes that the wheel bearing adjustment be maintained to limit
            excessive lateral run-out of the disc brake rotors.
        </para>
        <para>Lateral run-out or wobble in disc brakes can cause an increase in pedal travel due to piston knock-back,
            brake pedal pulsation during brake applications and increased piston seal wear since the pad has to follow
            the disc wobble. This wobbling condition causes the piston to become cocked in the piston bore, distorting
            the piston seal and causing abnormal pad wear.
        </para>
        <para>To limit lateral run-out of a rotor due to loose wheel bearings, adjust wheel bearings as instructed in
            GROUP 17 - WHEELS, RIMS AND TIRES in the CTS-5000 Master Service Manual.
