        <para>Lateral runout or wobble in disc brakes can cause an increase in pedal travel due to piston knockback,
            brake pedal pulsation during brake applications and increase piston seal wear since the pad is required to
            follow the disc wobble. This wobbling condition causes the piston to become cocked in the piston bores,
            distorting the seals.
        </para>
        <para>To limit lateral runout of a rotor (disc) due to loose bearings, refer to GROUP 02 - FRONT AXLE and GROUP
            14 - REAR AXLE in the Master Service Manual for proper wheel bearing adjustment.
        </para>
        <para>To limit lateral runout of a rotor (disc) due to a warped rotor, refer to GROUP 04 - BRAKES in the Master
            service Manual for proper reconditioning of rotors.
