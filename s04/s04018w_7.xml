            <para count="1">Mounting Studs installed into the wheel hub. The rotor is fastened to the wheel hub studs
                with washers and locknuts. When a rotor mounting stud is replaced, use Loctite Heavy Duty Lock N' Seal
                No. 277 (red), Loctite Dri-Loc adhesive No. 201 or Loctite 600 on the threads that screw into the wheel
                hub.

                complete the assembly.

            <para count="1">A wheel mounting stud that passes through a clearance hole in the rotor and then the
                serrated portion of the stud is pressed into the hub flange. When installing a new stud use one or more
                washers as required and a lock nut so that the serrated stud is drawn completely into the wheel hub and
                the head is firmly seated against the rotor.
