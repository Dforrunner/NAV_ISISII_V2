        <title>TESTING REBUILT COMPRESSOR</title>
        <para>In order to properly bench test a compressor under operating conditions, a test rack for correct mounting,
            cooling, lubricating, and driving the compressor is necessary. Such tests are not compulsory if the unit has
            been carefully rebuilt by an experienced person. A compressor efficiency or build up test can be run which
            is not difficult. The compressor must be connected to an oil supply line of at least 15 P.S.I. (103 kPa)
            pressure during the test and an oil return line must be installed to keep the crankcase drained.
        </para>
        <para>Connect the compressor discharge port to a reservoir with a volume of 650 cubic inches (10.65 L),
            including the volume of connecting line. With the compressor operating at 1800 R.P.M., the time required to
            raise the reservoir(s) pressure from 0 P.S.I.(0 kPa) to 100 P.S.I. (690 kPa)should not exceed 20 seconds
            with no inlet check valve or air strainer attached to the compressor inlet. During the test, the compressor
            should be checked for gasket leakage and noisy operation, as well as unloader operation and leakage.
