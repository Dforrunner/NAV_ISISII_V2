        <para>In the event that multiple failures occur, the dash lamp will react as it normally would during a single
            failure, and the EC-17 equipped with LEDs will show one fault at a time. When the first fault is fixed and
            the system is reset, the next fault area will appear at the LEDs. This way, the driver or mechanic does not
            lose track of fault areas, and the system is not restored until each and every error is corrected and the
            EC-17 is cleared of all faults.
