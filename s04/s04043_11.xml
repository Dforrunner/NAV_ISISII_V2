        <title>ATC OPERATION</title>
        <svcprocinfo>
            <para>Just as ABS improves vehicle stability during braking, ATC improves vehicle stability and traction
                during vehicle acceleration. By adding an ATC modulator and/or engine communication, the EC-30 ATC
                function uses the same wheel speed information and modulator control as the ABS function. The EC-30
                detects excessive drive wheel speed, compares the speed of the front, non-driven, wheels, and reacts to
                bring the wheel spin under control. The EC-30 can be configured to use engine torque limiting and/or
                differential braking to control wheel spin. For optimal ATC performance, both methods are recommended.
            </para>
            <para>During ATC activation, the EC-30 will blink the ATC active/ warning lamp to advise the driver that
                drive-wheel spin is occurring. When ATC is no longer active, the ATC active/ warning lamp turns off.
            </para>

            <title>Engine Torque Limiting ATC</title>
            <para>The engine torque limiting feature allows the EC-30 to reduce engine torque to a suitable level, in
                relation to the amount of available traction. When the engine torque is controlled, wheel slip can be
                optimized, producing more traction between the wheel and road surface. Engine torque limiting is
                especially beneficial in avoidance of a power jackknife and when all drive wheels are on an equally
                slippery surface. The EC-30 will verify that the driver is pressing the accelerator (using J1939 or
                J1922) prior to initiating an ATC event.
            </para>
            <para>In order for the engine torque limiting ATC feature to be used, the vehicle must be equipped with an
                electronically controlled engine and throttle. When configured for engine torque limiting ATC, the EC-30
                must be connected to an electronic engine via the SAE J1939 or J1922 serial communications links.
            </para>

        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Differential Braking ATC</title>
            <para>Differential braking ATC allows the EC-30 to gradually apply the brake on a spinning drive wheel.
                Since the vehicle's differential tends to drive the wheel that presents the least resistance (the wheel
                on the most slippery surface), a slight brake application to this wheel forces the differential to drive
                the wheel on the opposite side. The EC-30 applies brake pressure to both rear-axle ABS modulators by
                energizing the ATC modulator. The EC-30 can then apply pressure only to the spinning wheel by
                controlling the ABS modulators.
            </para>
            <para>Differential braking ATC can be activated only when vehicle speed is under 25 mph and one drive wheel
                is spinning faster than the others.
            </para>
            <para>In the event that differential braking, ATC is active for an excessive time period, the EC-30 will
                disable ATC to prevent overheating and fading of brakes. The EC-30 will re-enable ATC after a short
                period of time. The ATC active/warning lamp will be on while the ATC is disabled.
            </para>
            <para>In order for the differential braking control to be used, the vehicle must be equipped with an
                antilock/traction relay (ATR) valve (ATR-1 or ATR-2). The vehicle also must have an electronically
                controlled engine throttle.

            <title>ATC Enable/Disable Switch</title>
            <para>The ATC enable/disable switch allows the operator to enable or disable the ATC feature as necessary.
                ATC can be disabled while the vehicle is stationary or in motion. However, ATC will not re-enable until
                the vehicle comes to a complete stop, even with the switch in the enable position. The ATC
                active/warning lamp will be on while the ATC is disabled.
