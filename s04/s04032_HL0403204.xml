            <para>All EC-16 controllers manufactured on or after August 1, 1995 incorporate the self- configuring
                feature. New, replacement EC-16 controllers will be provided factory pre-programmed for 6 speed sensor
                inputs and both the differential braking and torque limiting features for traction control.
            </para>
            <para>The self-configuring EC-16 can most easily be identified while installed on the vehicle.
                Identification can be made by observing the reaction of the diagnostic display when the ignition is
                switched ON and power is applied to the EC-16. The current configuration of the EC-16 is displayed via
                the troubleshooting LEDs and occurs during the normal self-test sequence. This configuration review is
                repeated each time the ignition is turned on. The sequence and manner of LED illumination is described
                in the section entitled
                <hotlnk document="s04032_HL0403207.xml" xrefid="hl0403207">CONFIGURATION DISPLAY</hotlnk>. That section
                should also be used to confirm that the system is configured as desired.
            </para>
            <para>The diagnostic LEDs on older versions of the EC-16 will only react as described in Steps 2 and 6 under
                the section entitled
                <hotlnk document="s04032_HL0403207.xml" xrefid="hl0403207">CONFIGURATION DISPLAY</hotlnk>.
