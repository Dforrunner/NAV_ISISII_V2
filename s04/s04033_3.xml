            <para>The controller contains self-test and diagnostic circuitry that continuously checks for proper
                operation of the entire Antilock/Traction Control System, including wiring continuity. The system
                includes:

            <para>All of the ABS controllers are programmed at the factory (Bendix), and only those vehicles configured
                for traction control at International are programmed for traction control. A vehicle configured for
                traction control will have the Traction Active light and ON/OFF switch on the instrument panel.

            <title>Warning and Indicator Lights</title>
            <para>The ABS warning light and the Traction Active light inform the driver of the condition and status of
                the ABS/traction control system. The ten light emitting diodes (LEDs) on the controller provide the
                service technician with the condition of specific components in the system. No special tools are needed
                to interpret the diagnostic LED display.
