                    <warning>
                        <para>Brake Automatic Slack Adjusters (ASA's) should not need to be manually adjusted in
                            service. ASA's should not routinely have to be adjusted to correct excessive pushrod stroke.
                            Excessive stroke indicates that a problem exists with the foundation brake, ASA, brake
                            actuator, other brake system components or their installation or adjustment.
                        </para>
                        <para>In the event that a manual adjustment must be made (although this should not be a common
                            practice), a service appointment and full foundation brake, ASA, and other brake system
                            component inspection must be conducted as soon as possible to ensure the integrity of the
                            overall brake system prior to returning the vehicle to service.
