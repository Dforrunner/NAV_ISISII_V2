        <title>CONSUMPTION OF ALCOHOL</title>
        <para>Complaints of inoperative alcohol evaporator or excessive use of alcohol can be traced to either a wrong
            kit being installed or an incorrect installation of a kit. For that reason, the correct selection of a kit
            is very important.
        </para>
        <para>The consumption of alcohol will vary for different vehicles. The main determining factor on properly
            installed and maintained units is the percentage of time the air compressor is in its loaded (compressing)
            cycle. Since the alcohol is only used when the compressor is compressing air, good maintenance practice
            should be followed by keeping air leakage in the system to a minimum and keeping the brakes adjusted.
        </para>
        <para>It is difficult to estimate the amount of alcohol a vehicle will use. A guide to determine if the alcohol
            evaporator is working properly is:

        <para>
            <emph type="bold">Alcohol Usage:</emph>1 to 2 ozs. per hour if compressor is continuously pumping.
        </para>
        <para>Example: If a compressor on a tractor-trailer will be loaded (compressing air) 20% of the total operating
            time of 12 hours (or roughly 2-1/2 hours), consumption of alcohol can be calculated by multiplying 1 to 2
            ozs. x 2.5 hrs. (20% of the 12 hour compressor running time) equals approximately 1/3 to 1/2 pint of alcohol
            in 12 hours. Additional calculations reveal that if a compressor operates a greater percentage of time, more
            alcohol will be used.
