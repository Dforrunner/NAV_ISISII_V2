        <title>SPLIT AIR SYSTEM</title>
        <svcsubsecinfo>
            <para>The air system is a split system consisting of a primary service system and secondary service
                system.
            </para>
            <para>This split system begins where the main air supply reservoir branches off into two separate (primary
                and secondary) systems. This takes place through a series of check valves, separate air reservoirs and a
                brake valve which has two supply and delivery systems for service and emergency braking. The purpose of
                this split system is to provide a means of making a controlled stop if a failure occurs in either the
                primary or secondary air system. A tractor with a trailer has the advantage of utilizing the trailer air
                brake system during emergency stopping.
