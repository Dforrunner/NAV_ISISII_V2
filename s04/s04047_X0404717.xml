        <specpara>
            <warning>
                <para>Failure to bleed the system whenever any hydraulic system fitting is loosened or disconnected will
                    allow air to remain in the system. This will prevent the hydraulic pressure in the brake system from
                    rising enough to apply the brakes properly. This will cause the stopping distance to increase and
                    can result in serious personal injury.
                </para>
                <para>Properly discard hydraulic brake fluid that is removed from the brake system. Hydraulic brake
                    fluid that is removed can be contaminated and can cause damage, loss of braking and serious personal
                    injury.
                </para>
                <para>Use only the type of hydraulic brake fluid specified by the equipment manufacturer. Do not use or
                    mix different types of hydraulic brake fluid. The wrong hydraulic brake fluid will damage the rubber
                    parts of the brake caliper and can cause damage, loss of braking and serious personal injury.

        <para>The bleeder screw
            <hotlnk document="s04047_X0404715.xml" xrefid="f0404784">(Item 4, Figure 84)</hotlnk>

            is located in the upper (top) brake fluid port of caliper. It is not necessary to remove the wheel (tire and
            rim) to bleed the brakes.
        </para>
        <para>A brake fluid distribution passage between the two pistons is cast into the caliper, allowing brake fluid
            to pass from piston bore to piston bore. This requires only one bleeder screw. Tighten to 7.5 to 15 lbf-ft
            (10 to 20 N&#8226;m).
        </para>
        <para>Check the master cylinder reservoir and fill if necessary. Refer to GROUP 10 - LUBRICATION in the Master
            Service Manual for proper brake fluid.
        </para>
        <para>Bleed brakes in the following order: Right Rear, Left Rear, Right Front and Left Front.</para>
        <para>For brake bleeding procedure, refer to GROUP 04 - BRAKES in the Master Service Manual.</para>
        <specpara>
            <caution>
                <para>All International vehicles equipped with hydraulic disc brakes are equipped with a Hydro-Max Brake
                    Booster System. This system has two sections and each section is separate from the other. Each
                    section uses different types of fluid. The two fluids are NOT compatible and if mixed, severe damage
                    will occur to the contaminated component.
                </para>
            </caution>
        </specpara>
        <para>The Hydro-Max Booster is operated by the power steering system and uses power steering fluid only.</para>
        <para>The Braking System (Master Cylinder) uses hydraulic brake fluid only.</para>
        <specpara>
            <note>
                <para>Contaminated brake fluid is a maintenance error and is not covered by warranty.</para>
