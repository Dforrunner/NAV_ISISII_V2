        <title>TRACTION ACTIVE LIGHT</title>
        <para>The traction active light is located in the right gauge cluster. This light turns ON for a bulb test when
            the key is turned on, then goes out. The light will turn ON during vehicle operation to indicate that the
            traction control system is currently working to reduce wheel slip that the sensors have detected. The
            traction active light receives ignition power (key ON) through connector (420), on circuit 28C from 10A fuse
            F4-A. The ground side of the traction active light is connected through a connector (420), circuit 94BD to
            controller, 30-way connector (355), and terminal C2.
        </para>
        <para>The controller has a ground switch that opens (light OFF) and closes (light ON) the traction active light
            ground circuit in response to programmed instructions.
