    <p>Air brake equipment on trucks and truck-tractors provides a means of controlling brakes through the medium of
        compressed air. Air brakes consist of a group of devices: some maintain a supply of compressed air, some direct
        and control the flow of compressed air, and others transfer the energy of compressed air into the mechanical
        force and motion necessary to apply the brakes. Different types and sizes of devices are in use on different
        types of vehicles to meet operating requirements.</p>
