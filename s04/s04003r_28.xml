        <title>CRANKCASE</title>
        <para>Check all crankcase surfaces for cracks and damage. On compressors where ball bearing main bearings are
            used, the difference between the O.D. of the outer race and the I.D. of the crankcase hole should be .0003
            in. (.00762 mm) tight to .0023 in. (.05842 mm) loose. This is to maintain the correct fit. The compressor
            must be replaced if the fit is too loose.
        </para>
        <para>On compressors fitted with precision, sleeve main bearings, the difference between the O.D. of the
            crankshaft journal and the main bearing I.D. must not exceed .005 in (.127 mm). If the clearance is greater
            than .005 in. (.127 mm), the bearing must be replaced.
        </para>
        <para>The cylinder bores should be checked with inside micrometers or calipers. Cylinder bores which are scored
            or out of round by more than .0005 in. (.0127 mm) or tapered more than .0005 in. (.0127 mm) should be
            rebored or honed oversize. Oversized pistons and piston rings are available in .010 in. (.254 mm), .020 in.
            (.508 mm) and .030 in. (.762 mm) oversizes. Cylinder bores must be smooth, straight and round. Clearance
            between the cast iron pistons and cylinder bores should be between .002 in. (.0508 mm) minimum and .004 in.
            (.1016 mm) maximum.
