        <title>CRANKCASE</title>
        <para>Check all crankcase surfaces for cracks and damage. Pay particular attention to cooling fins. On
            compressors where ball bearing main bearings are used the difference between the O.D. of the outer race and
            the l.D. of the crankcase hole should be .0000 inch (mm) to .0015 inch (.038mm) loose. This is to maintain
            the correct press fit. The crankcase must be replaced if the fit is too loose.
        </para>
        <para>On compressors fitted with precision, sleeve main bearings, the difference between the O.D. of the
            crankshaft journal and the main bearing l.D. must not exceed .004 inch (.10 mm), or the end cover or main
            bearing must be replaced.
        </para>
        <para>The cylinder bore should be checked with inside micrometers or calipers. Cylinder bores which are scored
            or out of round by more than .0005 inch (.0127mm)or tapered more than .0005 inch (.0127mm)should be rebored
            or honed oversize. Oversized pistons and piston rings are available in .010 inch (.254mm), .020 inch
            (.508mm)and .030 inch (.762mm) oversizes. The cylinder bore must be smooth, straight, and round.
