        <title>INITIAL CHARGING</title>
        <para>During the initial build-up of tractor system air pressure, reservoir air flows into the supply port and
            through internal body and cover passages to the blend back piston and from there to the supply of the
            normally closed (NC) traction control solenoid. When sufficient air pressure is applied to the blend back
            piston, it moves against the resistance of its spring until it comes to rest against the service piston.
        </para>
        <para>Activating the trailer supply valve (dash control with red octagonal button) simultaneously charges the
            trailer and the ATR-2 control port. Air entering the ATR-2 control causes the proportioning piston to move
            toward its stop in the cover. The integral inlet and exhaust valve is carried along with the piston until it
            seats and seals the exhaust passage. Continued movement of the proportioning piston opens the inlet seat.
            With the tractor and trailer air system fully charged, the vehicle may be operated.
