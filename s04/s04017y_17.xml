            <para>Start engine. Once the engine is running, the power steering pump will circulate power steering fluid
                through the system. This will automatically purge air from the Hydro-Max&#8482; booster. Press on the
                brake pedal several times to make sure the pedal feels normal. With the engine off, press on the brake
                pedal several times to make sure the pedal feels normal in the backup pump mode. Check the inlet port
                and outlet port connections for leakage. Retighten if necessary. Check the interface, where the backup
                pump attaches to the Hydro-Max&#8482; booster for leakage. Check power steering pump reservoir level,
                add power steering fluid, if necessary. Road test the vehicle to make sure the vehicle stops properly.
