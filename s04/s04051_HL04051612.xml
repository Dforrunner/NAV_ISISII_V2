                    <para>The full power brake system is a pressurized system that achieves pressures of up to 2320 psi.

                    <para>Any form of contamination entering the system could prevent the system from operating
                        correctly. Thoroughly clean the area around fittings before disconnecting the fittings. Always
                        plug open ports and lines as quickly as possible. Contamination in the system could result in
                        loss of braking functions during vehicle operation. Failure to follow this warning could result
                        in property damage, personal injury or death.

                        professional assistance and repair. However, if location and circumstances prevent consulting
                        the dealer, and components are to be replaced, the prescribed procedure must be followed
                        accurately.
