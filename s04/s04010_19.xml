        <title>CRANKSHAFT</title>
        <para>Check crankshaft threads, keyways, tapered ends and all machined and ground surfaces for wear, scores or
            damage. Standard crankshaft journals are 1.1250 - 1.1241 inch (28.575 - 28.552mm) diameter. If the
            crankshaft journals are excessively scored or worn or out-of-round and cannot be reground, the crankshaft
            must be replaced. Connecting rod bearing inserts are available in .010 - .020 inch (.254 - .508mm) and .030
            inch (.762mm) undersizes for compressors with reground crankshafts.
        </para>
        <para>Main bearing journals must be maintained so the ball bearings are a snug fit or so that no more than .0065
            inch (.1651mm) clearance exists between the precision sleeve main bearing and the main bearing journals on
            the crankshaft. In crankshafts fitted with oil seal rings, the oil seal ring groove or grooves must not be
            worn. The ring groove walls must have a good finish and they must be square. Check to be sure the oil
            passages are open through the crankshaft.
