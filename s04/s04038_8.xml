            <para>Traction control is a natural extension of antilock. Just as antilock helps vehicle control and
                stability during braking, traction control helps during vehicle acceleration. The wheel speed sensors
                not only detect rapid decreases in wheel speed for antilock but also detect unreasonably high increases
                for traction control. With traction control, a spinning wheel is instantly detected and compared with
                the other wheels on the vehicle, both front and rear. Two different methods are used to control wheel
                spin; Torque Limiting and Differential Braking. Depending upon vehicle type, speed and road (surface)
                condition, each method provides a unique and desirable type of wheel spin control. Ideally both methods
                are used to control vehicle traction. While all EC-17s are capable of providing wheel control antilock
                and traction control (utilizing both methods of control), not all systems will be configured for both
                methods. Depending upon the vehicle, either or both traction control methods willbe activated during the
                Self Configuration procedure.
