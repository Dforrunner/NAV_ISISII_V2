            <para>Because some brake linings contain asbestos, workers who service brakes must understand the potential
                hazards of asbestos and precautions for reducing risks. Exposure to airborne asbestos dust can cause
                serious and possibly fatal diseases, including asbestosis (a chronic lung disease) and cancer,
                principally lung cancer and mesothelioma (a cancer of the lining of the chest or abdominal cavities).
                Some studies show that the risk of lung cancer among persons who smoke and who are exposed to asbestos
                is much greater than the risk for non-smokers. Symptoms of these diseases may not become apparent for
                15, 20 or more years after the first exposure to asbestos.
            </para>
            <para>Accordingly, workers must use caution to avoid creating and breathing dust when servicing brakes.
                Specific recommended work practices for reducing exposure to asbestos dust follow. Consult your employer
                for more details.

                    however, to what extent adherence to the maximum allowable exposure levels will eliminate the risk
                    of disease that can result from inhaling asbestos dust. OSHA requires that the following sign be

            <para>Most recently manufactured brake linings do not contain asbestos fibers. These brake linings may
                contain one or more of a variety of ingredients, including glass fibers, mineral wool, aramid fibers,
                ceramic fibers and silica that can present health risks if inhaled. Scientists disagree on the extent of
                the risks from exposure to these substances. Nonetheless, exposure to silica dust can cause silicosis, a
                non-cancerous lung disease. Silicosis gradually reduces lung capacity and efficiency and can result in
                serious breathing difficulty. Some scientists believe other types of non-asbestos fibers, when inhaled,
                can cause similar diseases of the lung. In addition, silica dust and ceramic fiber dust are known to the
                State of California to cause lung cancer. U.S. and international agencies have also determined that dust
                from mineral wool, ceramic fibers and silica are potential causes of cancer.

                    other ingredients found in non-asbestos brake linings be kept below 1.0 f/cc as an 8-hour
                    time-weighted average. Scientists disagree, however, to what extent adherence to these maximum
