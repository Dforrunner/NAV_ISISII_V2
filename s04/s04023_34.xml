                    <para>The only way the driver knows the Antilock Brake System is not working properly is when the
                        yellow dash warning light turns on. The driver will not be able to give you any useful
                        information to help you find the problem. It is important that you follow the Troubleshooting

            <step1>
                <para count="1">It is generally best to replace a wire harness, rather than repair individual wires in
                    the harness. If a splice repair must be made, it is important that the splice be properly soldered
                    with a rosin flux (not acid-based) and made waterproof.

                    moisture.

                        testing the individual pins or sockets in the connector.

                    Individual wire identification will differ depending upon the type of connectors in use, the vehicle
