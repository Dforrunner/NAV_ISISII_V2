        <title>BRAKING UNDER SLIPPERY CONDITIONS</title>
        <para>If a service brake application is made and the wheel speed sensors detect an imbalance (impending wheel
            lockup), the controller will immediately begin modification of brake application using the antilock
            modulator(s) at the wheel(s) sensing an impending lockup condition.
        </para>
        <para>Solenoid valves contained in the modulator are rapidly energized and de-energized by the controller in
            order to modify the brake application. When a solenoid coil is energized, its shuttle moves, and depending
            upon the function of the specific solenoid, it either opens or closes, thereby causing the exhaust or
            re-application of air pressure to the brake actuator. By opening and closing the solenoid valves in the
            appropriate modulator, the controller is actually simulating what the driver does when he "pumps the
            brakes." Unlike the driver, the controller receives input on which wheel is approaching lockup, and is able
            to pump each brake group on the vehicle independently and with far greater speed and accuracy.
