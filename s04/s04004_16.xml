        <title>DISCHARGE VALVE LEAKAGE</title>
        <para>Unloader piston leakage must be repaired before this test is performed. Leakage past the discharge valve
            can be detected by removing the discharge line, applying shop air to the unloader mechanism and the
            discharge port and listening for the escape of air at the compressor inlet cavity. A barely audible escape
            of air is generally acceptable; however, if there is any question as to the leakage rate, it is recommended
            that the cylinder head or compressor be removed and repaired or replaced. With shop air still applied at the
            discharge port, apply a soap solution to the valve stop recess on the top of the head. lf leakage is
            detected, the cylinder head must be repaired or replaced. Only genuine International service parts and kits
            should be used.
