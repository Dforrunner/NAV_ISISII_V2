            <para>This section contains general maintenance information and procedures. There is no regularly scheduled
                maintenance required for the Full Power Brake system.
            </para>
            <para>During bleeding, special tools may be required. Because the Master Cylinder (MC) system is isolated
                from the wheel caliper system, brake pedal feel does not indicate properly bled brakes. Air can still
                exists in the lines between the HCU and the calipers. Insure that ALL NECESSARY bleeding procedures have
                been properly performed after any repairs that require disconnecting brake lines. If lines are
                disconnected in both the MC circuit and the wheel caliper circuits; then, both bleeding procedures must
                be performed. If the HCU is removed or replaced, both bleeding procedures must be performed.

                <warning>
                    <para>When working around or under the vehicle, block the wheels to prevent the vehicle from moving.
                        When raising the vehicle, support the vehicle with safety stands. Do not work under a vehicle
                        supported only by jacks. Jacks can slip and fall over. Failure to follow this warning could
                        result in property damage, personal injury or death.

                    <para>The full power brake system is a pressurized system that achieves pressures of up to 2320 psi.

                    <para>Brake pedal feel does not necessarily indicate properly bled brakes. Brake pedal can feel firm
                        or "normal" if properly bled between the master cylinder reservoir and the HCU; and air can
                        still exists between the HCU and the brake calipers. Failure to correctly bleed the system could
                        cause reduced braking or loss of braking; which may result in property damage, personal injury
                        or death.

                    <para>This is a modern, complex system offering greater braking proficiency and features than
                        previous systems. If the system sustains damage or a component malfunctions and items need to be
                        replaced, users are strongly advised to contact the nearest International dealer for
                        professional assistance and repair. However, if location and circumstances prevent consulting
                        the dealer, and components are to be replaced, the prescribed procedure must be followed
                        accurately.
