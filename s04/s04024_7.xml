                <para>The only way the driver will know the Antilock Brake System is not working properly is when the
                    dash yellow warning light turns on. The driver will be able to give you little or no information to
                    help you find the problem.
                </para>

        <para>If a service brake application is made and the wheel speed sensors detect a wheel lock-up starting, the
            ECU will immediately begin changing the brake application using the M-21 antilock modulator(s) at the
            wheel(s) sensing a lock-up condition starting.
        </para>
        <para>Solenoid valves contained in the modulator are rapidly energized and de-energized by the ECU to change the
            brake application. When a solenoid coil is energized, its shuttle moves, and depending upon the function of
            the specific solenoid, it either opens or closes, thereby causing the exhaust or re-application of air
            pressure to the brake actuator. By opening and closing the solenoid valves in the appropriate modulator, the
            ECU is actually simulating what the driver does when he "pumps the brakes." Unlike the driver, the ECU
            receives input on which wheel is approaching lock-up, and is able to pump each brake group on the vehicle
            independently and with far greater speed and accuracy.
