            <para>It is difficult to determine an exact maintenance schedule (time or mileage) since vehicles will be
                used in wide varieties of operational applications and conditions.
            </para>
            <para>Vehicles operating under severe conditions, such as frequent stop and go driving, mountainous terrain
                or loaded more than 50% of payload, will require more service maintenance checks than a vehicle which is
                used over the road. Therefore, a regular schedule for periodic inspection should be established based on
                past experience and type of operation.
            </para>
            <para>Disc brakes do not require adjustment since the clearance is maintained by the movement of the caliper
                pistons.
            </para>
            <para>Be sure to keep in mind that the Hydro-Max Booster system consists of two completely separate
                hydraulic systems operating on two different incompatible fluids; power steering fluid and hydraulic
                brake fluid. Refer to GROUP 04 - BRAKES and GROUP 05 - STEERING in the Master Service Manual for
                complete details covering the Hydro-Max Booster system and Power Steering.
