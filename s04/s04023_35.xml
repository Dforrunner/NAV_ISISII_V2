            <title>Self-Diagnostics</title>
            <para>The ECU contains self-test and diagnostic circuitry that continuously checks for proper operation of
                the entire antilock system, including wiring continuity. A yellow warning light located on the
                instrument panel, controlled by the ECU, advises the driver of the condition of the antilock system. The
                condition of specific antilock components is provided to the mechanic by a series of labeled, Light
                Emitting Diodes (LEDs) displayed through a window in the ECU.
            </para>
            <para>No special tools or equipment are needed to read or interpret the ECU diagnostics window. It should be
                noted that the ECU diagnostics display is separate from the yellow antilock condition light on the dash.
                With this separation, the driver is only aware there is a problem.
            </para>
            <para>A special feature of the ECU controller is the failure signal and diagnostic system. Off and on
                problems, particularly in the wheel speed sensing area, can be difficult to diagnose. When the
                controller senses a failure, whether in the controller electronics, the modulator or wheel speed sensing
                areas, it stores the information in the ECU, disables the antilock function, turns on the dash mounted
                antilock condition light and the appropriate diagnostic LEDs on the ECU.
            </para>
            <para>Failure information is stored and is not lost because of loss of power to the ECU. The LEDs will
                re-light when power is restored and remain on until the failure is corrected. After the actual problem
                is corrected, you can clear or reset the ECU diagnostics by passing a small magnet over the RESET point
                in the diagnostics window.

            </para>
            <para>While the yellow antilock warning light on the instrument panel indicates a system defect, and the ECU
                diagnostic display locates a specific problem area, it is still necessary to confirm whether the problem
                is in the component, the wiring, or a faulty or mis-adjusted chassis component. Test procedure charts
                are provided to interpret the dash light self test, and the condition of the LEDs.

                you to the next test flow chart based on performance of the Dash Light and ECU LEDs.
