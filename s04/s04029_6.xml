        <title>TRACTION CONTROL WHEN VEHICLE SPEED IS 0 TO 25 MPH</title>
        <para>When wheel spin is detected and the vehicle is stopped or moving at less than 25 mph, the controller
            simultaneously executes the following operations:
        </para>
        <step1>
            <para count="1">The controller instantly blinks the Traction Active light on the instrument panel to advise
                the driver that wheel spin is occurring.
            </para>
        </step1>
        <step1>
            <para count="1">The controller uses its J1922 Data Link connection to the engine electronic control module
                (ECM) to send a signal causing the ECM to reduce engine torque to a level suitable for the available
                traction.
            </para>
        </step1>
        <step1>
            <para count="1">The controller opens and closes the solenoid valve in the appropriate modulator valve to
                gently pump the brake on the spinning wheel, to force the differential to drive the stationary or slowly
                spinning wheel.
            </para>
        </step1>
        <step1>
            <para count="1">Once wheel spin is eliminated, the controller turns the Traction Active light on the
                instrument panel off, and disengages control of the system.
