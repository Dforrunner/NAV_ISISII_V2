        <title>ANTILOCK OPERATION - GENERAL</title>
        <para>If a service brake application is made and the antilock system detects an impending wheel lockup, the
            antilock controller will immediately begin modification of the brake application using the modulator.
        </para>
        <para>To modify the brake application, the coils of the two solenoid valves contained in the modulator are
            energized or de-energized in a pre-programmed sequence by the antilock controller. When a solenoid coil is
            energized, a shuttle within the solenoid moves, and depending upon the function of the specific solenoid, it
            either opens or closes, thereby causing the exhaust or re-application of air pressure to the brake actuator.
            The solenoids in the modulator are controlled independently by the antilock controller. By opening and
            closing the solenoid valves in the modulator, the antilock controller is able to simulate what the driver
            does when he "pumps the brakes." It must be remembered, however, that unlike the driver, the antilock
            controller is able to "pump" each modulator, along with the brakes connected to it, independently and with
            far greater speed and accuracy.
