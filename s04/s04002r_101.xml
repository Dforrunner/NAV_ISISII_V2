            <para>The valve incorporates a manifold that accommodates two brake valve or foot valve ports plus a hand
                control port through two built-in, two-way check valves for service brake application. It also
                incorporates a quick release feature, automatic shut off on loss of emergency trailer air, and an
                automatic bleed back of any trapped service air.
            </para>
            <para>The valve determines whether the service air brake line that connects the tractor and trailer systems
                is open or closed. The emergency passage through the valve is always open. The opening and closing of
                the service air brake lines is established by shuttling a spring loaded tapered piston working against
                piston forces developed by air pressure levels in the emergency passage.
            </para>
            <para>Manual activation of the valve is performed by the operator through the use of the trailer supply
                (red) knob at the instrument panel.
            </para>
            <para>When the trailer supply control is opened (red knob pushed in), air pressure is supplied to the
                emergency port to open the tractor protection valve. Pulling the red trailer supply control knob "out"
                exhausts the emergency line at the air control valve, allowing the tractor protection valve to close.
            </para>
            <para>A quick release feature incorporated in the service passage serves to improve brake release time
                response. During service brake release, the service line air pressure in the trailer system is exhausted
                to the atmosphere at the tractor protection valve as compared to exhausting at the foot valve or hand
                control valve.
            </para>
            <para>The automatic shut-off bleed back feature allows the valve to automatically shut off under a full
                service brake application. When the trailer supply control is pulled out while the service brakes are
                applied, the bleed back feature allows the trapped air in the trailer service line to bleed to 0 psi
                pressure.
            </para>
            <para>During tractor operation without trailer, the trailer supply control knob is "out" and the "service"
                passage at the tractor protection valve is closed. The trailer supply control valve blocks the air
                pressure to the emergency passage to the tractor protection valve. Air passages leading from the tractor
                system to the trailer couplings are blocked.
            </para>
            <para>When coupling the tractor to the trailer, the trailer supply control (red) knob is pushed "in." Air
                flows through the tractor protection valve emergency line to charge trailer brake system reservoirs.
                Trailer brakes are released simultaneously if trailer brakes are holding prior to coupling. When the air
                pressure in the emergency line reaches approximately 40 to 50 psi, the tractor protection valve service
                passage will open.
            </para>
            <para>During normal tractor-trailer operation, the tractor protection valve remains open, allowing air to
                flow in either direction between tractor and trailer air brake system. Trailer service brakes are
                applied and released by operation of either the foot brake valve or hand control valve, when air flows
                through the service passage of the tractor protection valve. Trailer air reservoirs and brake system are
                replenished by air flow through the emergency passage.

                illustrates the tractor protection valve in the normally closed position for operating the tractor
                without a trailer.
            </para>
            <para>The rubber valve (Item 8) is seated against the check valve body (Item 6) by the piston (Item 10)
                closing off passage of air through the valve from tractor service ports (H and I) to trailer service
                port (M). Cavity (B) is vented to the exhaust through the trailer emergency control (not shown) located
                in the cab dash panel. The trailer service port (M) and cavity (A) are vented to atmosphere.
            </para>
            <para>After connecting the trailer and pushing the trailer emergency control valve knob "in," air pressure
                is supplied from the tractor system through cavity (B) from tractor emergency port (J) to trailer
                emergency port (L). Air pressure above 40 to 50 psi against the piston (Item 10) causes it to move
                toward the spring (Item 12). The piston bottoms out on the exhaust disc (Item 13) which is held securely
                in place by the snap ring (Item 16). Service air passage from tractor to trailer is open.
            </para>
            <para>During normal service brake application, the controlled air supplied by the foot valve enters the
                service ports marked foot valve #1 (primary) and foot valve #2 (secondary). The air pressure moves the
                valve disc (Item 3) against the cover (Item 2), closing off the hand control port (G). Air is allowed to
                enter cavity (A).
            </para>
            <para>The air pressure moves the valve (Item 8) down to seat on the piston (Item 10) blocking off cavity
                (C). Air then flows around the diaphragm and out the trailer service port (M) to the trailer brakes. The
                air supplied by the hand control valve enters the service port (G) marked "hand control." The air
                pressure moves the valve disc (Item 3) under the cover (Item 2) against the seat on the check valve body
                (Item 6) blocking the air passage to the foot valve port #1 (H). The air flows around the valve disc
                (Item 3) and enters cavity (D). The air pressure pushes the valve disc (Item 3) against the cover (Item
                4) blocking the air passage to the foot valve port #2 (Item I). The air pressure enters cavity (A) and
                continues the same function as previously stated in service brake application above.
            </para>
            <para>When the service brakes are released, the controlled air supplied through and downstream of the
                tractor protection valve acts to unseat the valve (Item 8) from the exhaust seat on the piston (Item
                10). The exhaust air enters cavity (C) and out exhaust port (K). Air upstream from the tractor
                protection valve is exhausted through the foot valve or hand control valve.
            </para>
            <para>If service brake system pressure on the tractor drops to 30 to 40 psi, spring (Item 12) force moves
                the piston (Item 10) towards the inlet seat on the check valve body (Item 6) and closes the tractor to
                trailer service port (M).
            </para>
            <para>The automatic shut-off and bleed back feature functions when the service brakes or hand control valve
                is applied. When the trailer emergency dash control valve is pulled out, pressure in cavity (B) will be
                reduced to 0 psi, trapping applied service brake pressure in the trailer service port (M). At this time,
                the trapped air will bleed by the one-way check disc (Item 21) into cavity (B), which is exhausted to
                the atmosphere through the trailer emergency valve at the instrument panel.
