        <title>UNLOADING (NOT COMPRESSING)</title>
        <para>When air pressure in the system reaches the maximum governor pressure setting, the governor is actuated
            causing the unloader pins to hold the inlet valves off their seats (open). With the inlet valves open, air
            passes freely back and forth between the cylinders and the intake cavity in the cylinder head. This stops
            the compression of air until the pressure in the system is reduced to the governor cut-in setting. Then the
            governor operates by releasing the unloader pins which allows the inlet valves to operate normally
            permitting air compression.
