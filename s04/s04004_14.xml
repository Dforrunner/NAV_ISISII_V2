        <title>OPERATIONAL TESTS</title>
        <para>Every three months, 900 operating hours or 25,000 miles whichever occurs first. Vehicles manufactured
            after the effective date of FMVSS 121, with the minimum required reservoir volume, must have a compressor
            capable of raising air system pressure from 85-100 p.s.i. (586-690 kPa) in 25 seconds or less. This test is
            performed with the engine operating at maximum governed speed. The vehicle manufacturer must certify this
            performance on new vehicles with appropriate allowances for air systems with greater than the minimum
            required reservoir volume.
        </para>
        <para>Check unloader operation by building system pressure to governor cut-out and note that air compression
            stops. Reduce system pressure to governor cut-in and note that air compression resumes. lf the compressor
            fails to respond as described, make certain the governor is functioning properly before repairing or
            replacing the compressor.
