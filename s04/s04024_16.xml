            <para>Each M - 21 modulator contains (1)
                <emph type="italic">exhaust solenoid</emph>
                and (1)
                <emph type="italic">hold solenoid</emph>. During this test, the ECU controller will "fire" or energize
                each solenoid briefly in a test cycle making a "chuff" sound as the air exhausts. The exhaust solenoid
                will be "fired" for 10 milli - seconds, then a pause for only a few milli - seconds and the hold
                solenoid will "fire" for 20 milli - seconds. The two firing in rapid sequence will produce a "chuff"
                sound. The ECU will begin at the right front, then go to the left front, then right rear, and finish the
                cycle on the left rear. It will then repeat the cycle, making two complete cycles.
