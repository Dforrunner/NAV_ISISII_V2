        <title>TRACTION CONTROL</title>
        <svcprocinfo>
            <para>Traction control is a natural extension of antilock. Just as antilock helps vehicle control and
                stability during braking, traction control helps during vehicle acceleration. The wheel speed sensors
                not only detect rapid decreases in wheel speed for antilock but also detect unreasonably high increases
                for traction control. With traction control, a spinning wheel is instantly detected and compared with
                the other wheels on the vehicle, both front and rear. Two different methods are used to control wheel
                spin: Torque Limiting and Differential Braking. Depending upon vehicle type, speed and road (surface)
                condition, each method provides a unique and desirable type of wheel spin control. Ideally both methods
                are used to control vehicle traction. While all new version EC-16s are capable of providing wheel
                control antilock and traction control (using both methods of control), not all systems will be
                configured for both methods. Depending upon the vehicle, either or both traction control methods will be
                activated during the Self-Configuration procedure.

            <title>Torque Limiting</title>
            <para>In order for the torque limiting control feature to be used, the vehicle must be equipped with an
                electronically controlled engine throttle. The torque limiting feature allows the EC-16 to reduce engine
                torque to a suitable level for the available traction. Torque limiting helps to minimize the amount (or
                speed) of wheel spin. It is especially useful in helping to minimize a power jackknife and when all
                drive wheels are on an equally slippery surface.

        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Differential Braking</title>
            <para>In order for the differential braking control feature to be used, the vehicle must be equipped with an
                antilock traction relay valve such as the Bendix ATR-1 or 2. The ATR-1 and 2 contain a solenoid assembly
                which provides this feature. The differential braking feature allows the EC-16 to gently pump the brake
                on the spinning wheel. Since the vehicle's differential tends to drive the wheel that presents the least
                resistance (the wheel on the slipperiest surface), a slight brake application to this wheel only forces
                the differential to drive the stationary or slowly spinning wheel. While a vehicle must be equipped with
                an electronic throttle to use the Torque Limiting feature of traction control, Differential Braking can
                be used on all vehicles. Differential Braking can be activated only when vehicle speed is under 25 MPH
                and one drive wheel is spinning faster than the other(s).

            <title>Traction Control at Vehicle Speeds of 0 to 25 MPH</title>
            <para>When wheel spin is detected and the vehicle is stopped, or moving at any speed up to 25 MPH, the EC-16
                controller simultaneously executes the following operations:
            </para>

                    <para>It instantly blinks the traction dash lamp to advise the driver that a wheel spin is
                        occurring.

                </item>
                <item>
                    <para>If the Torque Limiting feature is active, the EC-16 uses its link to the engine control module
                        and sends a signal to reduce engine torque to a level suitable for the available traction.
                    </para>

                <item>
                    <para>If the Differential Braking feature is configured into the system, the EC-16 energizes the
                        solenoid in the ATR valve which then applies air to each of the rear axle modulators. Because
                        the modulators are controlled by the EC-16, the solenoid valves in the appropriate modulator are
                        opened and closed to gently pump the brake on the spinning wheel only. This gentle brake
                        application forces the differential to drive the stationary or slowly spinning wheel.

            <title>Traction Control at Vehicle Speeds Above 25 MPH</title>
            <para>If wheel spin occurs at any speed above 25 mph, the EC-16 will instantly blink the traction dash lamp
                to advise the driver that a wheel spin is occurring.
            </para>
            <para>If the Torque Limiting feature is programmed in, the EC-16 uses its link to the engine control module
                and sends a signal to reduce engine torque to a level suitable for the available traction. THE EC-16
                WILL NOT SIGNAL THE ATR VALVE TO APPLY THE BRAKES, EVEN SLIGHTLY, AT ANY SPEED ABOVE 25 MPH.
