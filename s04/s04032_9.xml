        <title>ANTILOCK AND TRACTION WIRING</title>
        <para>The wires that carry information and power into and out of the EC-16 are generally grouped and terminate
            at a connector. The connectors used on the EC-16 are illustrated in
            <hotlnk document="s04032_2.xml" xrefid="f0403203">Figure 3</hotlnk>. The wiring harnesses and connectors are
            weather resistant and the wires that enter the connector are sealed to the connector.
        </para>
        <para>When diagnosing wiring in the antilock system, the following general rules apply and should be followed
            where applicable:

        <step1>
            <para count="1">It is generally advisable to replace a wire harness rather than repair individual wires in
                the harness. If a splice repair must be made, it is important that the splice be properly soldered with
                a rosin flux (not acid based) and made waterproof.

        </step1>
        <step1>
            <para count="1">Do not pierce wire insulation when checking for continuity. Check for power, ground or
                continuity by disconnecting the connector and testing the individual pins or sockets in the connector.
            </para>

        <step1>
            <para count="1">Always check the vehicle circuit diagram book for wire and connector identification.
                Individual wire identification will differ depending upon the type of connectors in use and the system
                features in use.

                present on all EC-16 controllers, they are not always used.
