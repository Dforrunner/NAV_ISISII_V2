            <para>With no air pressure applied to the QR-N (

                ), the diaphragm is slightly flexed by the upper and lower body. In this condition, the center portion
                of the diaphragm rests on the exhaust port in the lower body while the outer edge and opposite side of
                the diaphragm rests against the sealing lip of the upper body.

            <title>Applying Air</title>
            <para>Air entering the supply port of the QR-N causes the center portion of the diaphragm to seal the
                exhaust port. Simultaneously, the outer edge of the diaphragm moves away from the sealing lip of the
                upper body, allowing air to flow from the supply port out the delivery port to the brake chambers,
                applying the brakes.

        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Balance</title>
            <para>When air pressure on both sides of the diaphragm is approximately equal (1 psi differential), the
                natural resiliency of the diaphragm material causes the outer edge of the diaphragm to move into contact
                with the upper body sealing lip. The QR-N exhaust remains sealed because air pressure bears against the
                center portion of the diaphragm from one side only, allowing air to continue to flow out of the delivery
                ports to the brake chambers.
            </para>

        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Release</title>
            <para>When air pressure is reduced or removed from the QR-N supply port, the air pressure on the delivery
                side of the diaphragm is greater than that on the supply side. The higher delivery side pressure holds
                the outer edge of the diaphragm against the upper body sealing lip while simultaneously moving the
                center portion away from the exhaust port. Air from the delivery ports flows out the exhaust. When air
                pressure on the delivery side of the diaphragm equals the pressure on the supply side, the center
                portion of the diaphragm moves into contact with the exhaust port, shutting off the exhaust port,
                releasing the brakes.
