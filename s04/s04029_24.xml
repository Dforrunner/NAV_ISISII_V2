                    inspected to ensure that the LEDs are functional. With the vehicle ignition ON, a magnet (800 gauss;
                    capable of picking up 3 ounces) held to the LED reset switch should cause all of the LEDs to
                    illuminate.

                    indicates the system is functioning properly, the non-illuminated LED(s) should be noted for future
                    reference. Although the diagnostic capabilities will be limited, the system will continue to
                    function as designed.

                    When an antilock stop is made, the modulator solenoids pulsate and an audible burst of air can be
                    heard from outside of the cab by an observer. The wheels should not enter a prolonged "lock"
                    condition when vehicle speeds are above seven miles per hour.
