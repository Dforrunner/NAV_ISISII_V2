            <para count="1">Before installing the backup pump (Item 2) onto the Hydro-Max&#8482; booster (Item 3),
                examine the sealing surfaces of both the backup pump and Hydro-Max&#8482; booster housing for damage. If
                no damage exists, continue to the next step. If the sealing surface is damaged on either the backup pump
                and/or the Hydro-Max&#8482; booster housing replace the unit with the damaged sealing surface.

        <para>Start engine. Once the engine is running, the power steering pump will circulate power steering fluid
            through the system. This will automatically purge air from the Hydro-Max&#8482; booster. Press on the brake
            pedal several times to make sure the pedal feels normal. With the engine off, press on the brake pedal
            several times to make sure the pedal feels normal in the backup pump mode. Check the interface, where the
            backup pump attaches to the Hydro-Max&#8482; booster for leakage. Check power steering pump reservoir level,
            add power steering fluid, if necessary. Road test the vehicle to make sure the vehicle stops properly.
