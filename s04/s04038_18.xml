                    <para>Road test the vehicle by making an antilock stop from a vehicle speed of 20 miles per hour.
                        When an antilock stop is made, the modulator solenoids pulsate and an audible burst of air can
                        be heard from outside of the cab. The wheels should not enter a prolonged "lock" condition.
                        Also, make a traction acceleration by accelerating on a road surface with reduced traction. As
                        with antilock, audible bursts of air can be heard when the traction system is functioning.
