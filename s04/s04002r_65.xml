            <para>Block vehicle wheels; brake system will be inoperative. Charge air brake system to governor cut-out
                pressure.
            </para>
            <step1>
                <para count="1">Place parking control valve in the "apply" position. Observe that the spring brake
                    actuators apply promptly. In the delivery port of the inversion valve, install a test gauge known to
                    be accurate. Place the parking control valve in the "release" position. Observe that the spring
                    brake actuators release fully.

                <para count="1">With the parking control valve in the "release" position, note the gauge pressure
                    reading (should be approximately the same as gauge on instrument panel). If the pressure reading is
                    incorrect, the valve must be repaired or replaced.

                <para count="1">Place the parking control valve in the "apply" position. The gauge reading should drop
                    to zero promptly. A slow release of pressure could indicate faulty operation of the single check
                    valve (within the modulating valve). At approximately 7 to 35 psi, the spring parking brakes should
                    be fully applied.

                    decreases each time the foot brake valve is applied. After the foot brake valve has been applied
                    several times, pressure on the gauge will drop to the point where release of the spring brake
                    actuators will no longer occur.
