        <para>Brake drums should be cleaned thoroughly with a steam cleaner or hot water. Do not use a solvent which
            leaves an oily residue. If inspection shows the drums may be used without re-machining, rub friction surface
            with fine emery cloth or sandpaper to remove any foreign deposits. If drum has been reconditioned, clean
            friction surface with fine emery cloth or sandpaper and wash. Examine very carefully to see that no metal
            chips remain in drum.
