            <para>The controller contains self-test and diagnostic circuitry that continuously checks for proper
                operation of the entire Antilock/Traction Control system, including wiring continuity. The system
                includes:

            <para>All of the ABS controllers are programmed at the factory (Bendix), and only those vehicles configured
                for traction control at International are programmed for traction control. A vehicle configured for
                traction control will have the Traction Active light and ON/OFF switch on the instrument panel.
