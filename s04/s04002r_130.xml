        <para>When the air compressor is in the compressing cycle, a partial vacuum is present at the compressor intake.
            A line from the evaporator is connected to the compressor intake, therefore a vacuum is created above the
            alcohol in the alcohol reservoir. Air at atmospheric pressure or greater, depending upon the type of
            installation, enters the evaporator and passes through the tube which is immersed in the alcohol.
        </para>
        <para>This air passing through the alcohol causes the alcohol to bubble and the vapor formed by the bubbling is
            induced into the compressor intake and into the air system.
