            <para>When the lever is actuated in the delivery position, the hollow plunger of the valve is depressed and
                makes contact with the inlet valve and unseats it. In this position, the exhaust passage through the
                hollow plunger is closed and air from the inlet port has free passage through the two-way valve and out
                the delivery port to the device being operated.

        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Releasing</title>
            <para>When the lever is released, the plunger is raised by the plunger spring and the inlet valve removed to
                its seat and is held closed by the inlet valve spring and inlet air pressure. Any air pressure in line
                or lines connecting the two-way valve with the device being operated will be exhausted through the
                hollow plunger and exhaust opening near the top of the valve.
