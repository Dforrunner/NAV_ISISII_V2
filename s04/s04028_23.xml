            <para>Each M-21 modulator contains (1) exhaust solenoid and (1) hold solenoid. During this test, the
                controller will "fire" or energize each solenoid briefly in a test cycle making a "chuff" sound as the
                air exhausts. The exhaust solenoid will be "fired" for 10 milli-seconds, then a pause for only a few
                milli-seconds and the hold solenoid will "fire" for 20 milli-seconds. The two firing in rapid sequence
                will produce a "chuff" sound. The controller will begin at the right front, then go to the left front,
                then right rear, and finish the cycle on the left rear. It will then repeat the cycle, making two
                complete cycles.
