        <title>DIFFERENTIAL BRAKING</title>
        <para>In order for the differential braking control feature to be used, the vehicle must be equipped with an
            antilock traction relay valve such as the Bendix ATR 1 or 2. The ATR 1 and 2 contain a solenoid assembly
            which provides this feature. The differential braking feature allows the EC-17 to gently pump the brake on
            the spinning wheel. Since the vehicle's differential tends to drive the wheel that presents the least
            resistance (the wheel on the most slippery surface), a slight brake application to this wheel only, forces
            the differential to drive the stationary or slowly spinning wheel. While a vehicle must be equipped with an
            electronic throttle to utilize the Torque Limiting feature of traction control, Differential Braking can be
            used on all vehicles. Differential Braking can be activated only when vehicle speed is under 25 MPH and one
            drive wheel is spinning faster than the other(s).
