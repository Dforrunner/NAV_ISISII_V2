        <title>TESTING REBUILT COMPRESSOR</title>
        <para>In order to properly test a compressor under operating conditions, a test rack for correct mounting,
            cooling, lubricating, and driving the compressor is necessary. Such tests are not compulsory if the unit has
            been carefully rebuilt by an experienced person. A compressor efficiency or build up test can be run which
            is not too difficult. An engine-lubricated compressor must be connected to an oil supply line of at least 15
            psi pressure during the test and an oil return line must be installed to keep the crankcase drained.
        </para>
        <para>Connect the compressor discharge port to a reservoir with a volume of 1500 cubic inches, including the
            volume of the connecting line. With the compressor operating at 2100 R.P.M., the time required to raise the
            reservoir(s) pressure from 85 psi to 100 psi should not exceed 7 seconds. During this test, the compressor
            should be checked for gasket leakage and noisy operation, as well as unloader operation and leakage. If the
            compressor functions as indicated, reinstall on the vehicle, connecting all lines as marked in the
            disassembly procedure.
