            <para count="1">The observer should note the movement (stroke) of the front slack adjusters and the position

            <para count="1">The observer should observe a further movement (increased stroke) of the front axle slack
                adjusters and yoke-pin.
            </para>
        </step1>
        <para>The front axle slack adjusters and yoke-pins should move away from the chambers as a result of the partial
            brake application in step 4 and then move further away from the chamber (longer stroke) after the trailer
            brake control is released (deactivated) in step 6. These two reactions confirm that the front axle brakes
            operate at full pressure with the tractor in the "bobtail mode" and at reduced pressure when the tractor is
            coupled to a trailer.
