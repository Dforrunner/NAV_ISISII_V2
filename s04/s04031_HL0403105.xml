                governor cut-out and make 4 to 5 full brake applications. Check the air fittings at the ATR-2 for
                leakage. Tighten as needed.

                control (dash control with yellow diamond button) activated for tractor/trailer operation, apply and
                release the brakes several times and check for prompt application and release at each wheel. If prompt
                reaction is noted at some, but not all wheels, test the antilock modulator (M-21 or M-22) between the
                ATR-2 and the brake chamber for proper operation. If a "sluggish" response is noted at all wheels,
                inspect for a kinked or obstructed air line leading to or from the ATR-2. If a complete release of the
                brakes is noted at some, but not all wheels, test the antilock modulator (M-21 or M-22) between the
                ATR-2 and the brake chamber for proper operation. If an incomplete release is noted at all wheels,
                inspect for a kinked or obstructed air line leading to or from the ATR-2.

                pressure registered at the delivery port. Subtract delivery port pressure from the 10 psi service
                pressure to obtain the differential. Compare the measured differential with the pressure specified for
                the ATR-2 part number (see the I.D. washer also for the differential).

            <para count="1">Activate the dash mounted trailer supply valve for bobtail tractor operation. Then make a
                slow brake application, increasing the pressure at the ATR-2 service port to 20 psi while watching the
                reaction at the delivery port gauge. Note that delivery pressure rises to approximately 5 to 10 psi and
                remains constant while service pressure continues to rise to 20 psi. Release the application.

                between 60 and 70 psi while observing the gauge installed at the delivery port. Note that when service
                port pressure rises to between 20 and 30 psi, delivery pressure begins to rise above the initial
                pressure noted in step 6. The rise of delivery pressure should be at a proportioned rate of
                approximately 3 to 1. At 70 psi service pressure, delivered pressure should be 15 to 25 psi.

                        a full (100 psi or greater) brake application, the ATR-2 MAY begin to cycle between an apply and
                        exhaust mode. This condition is normal while the ATR-2 is transitioning from the proportioning
                        mode to the full delivery mode and will only occur if the service application is SLOWLY
                        increased as described. Cycling will not occur or can be stopped by increasing or decreasing
                        service port pressure.
