        <title>COMPRESSION</title>
        <para>During the down stroke of each piston, air is drawn into the cylinder head. As each piston begins an
            upstroke, the inlet valve closes, and the air above the piston is compressed.
        </para>
        <para>When the cylinder air pressure becomes greater than the system air pressure in the cylinder head above the
            exhaust valve, the exhaust valve is forced off the valve seat. Air passes through the exhaust valve into the
            head cavity and into the air line leading to the air reservoir tank.
        </para>
        <para>As the piston starts a downstroke, the exhaust valve returns to its valve seat. Compressed air is
            prevented from returning to the cylinder, and the intake and compression cycle is repeated.
