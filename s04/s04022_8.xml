                    should be inspected to ensure that the LEDs are functional. With the vehicle ignition ON, a magnet
                    (800 gauss; capable of picking up 3 ounces) held to the LED reset switch should cause all of the
                    LED's to illuminate. If one or more of the LED's DO NOT ILLUMINATE and the antilock warning light on
                    the dash indicates the system is functioning properly, the non-illuminated LED(s) should be noted
                    for future reference. Although the diagnostic capabilities will be limited, the system will continue
                    to function as designed.
