                <caution>
                    <para>Only test gauges known to be accurate are to be used for checking brake valve delivery
                        pressures, gover- nor pressure settings and other tests.

            </specpara>
            <para>Use air pressure source equipped with in-line manual shut-off valve, an air gauge known to be accurate
                and a connection adaptor. Connect air source to inlet port. Also connect a manifold with an air gauge
                and close manual shut off valve to outlet. With air control valve in "out" position, open manual valve
                to build up 100 to 125 psi to inlet port. Shut off manual valve. No air leakage is allowed around piston
                or through casting surfaces. Permissible leakage at exhaust port is a 1 inch (25 mm) diameter soap
                bubble in six seconds.
            </para>
            <para>Push control valve in and build up 100 to 125 psi pressure at both inlet and outlet. Shut off manual
                valve and repeat above leakage test.
            </para>
            <para>Pull control valve out. Outlet port pressure should exhaust to zero through valve.</para>

        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Operation Test</title>
            <para>Begin with zero pressure at inlet and outlet. Hold control valve IN and open manual valve to allow 7
                to 17 psi on straight trucks and buses built before April 3, 1992, and 25 to 35 psi on straight trucks
                and buses built after April 3, 1992 to build up at both the inlet and outlet. The control valve should
                remain IN at pressures above 7 to 17 psi on straight trucks and buses built before April 3, 1992, and 25
                to 35 psi on straight trucks and buses built after April 3, 1992.
            </para>
            <para>Second check is accomplished with 100 to 125 psi in both inlet and outlet ports and both manual
                shut-off valves closed. Slowly open manual valve at outlet to bleed down pressure. The spring brake
                control should automatically move "out" when air pressure at inlet port reaches 7 to 17 psi on straight
                trucks and buses built before April 3, 1992 and 25 to 35 psi on straight trucks and buses built after
                April 3, 1992.
            </para>
            <para>If spring brake control valve does not perform as described, it should be repaired or replaced.</para>
