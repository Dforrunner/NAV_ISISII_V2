                <para count="1">With a fully charged air system, check delivery pressure of both primary and secondary
                    systems using test gauges known to be accurate. Depress pedal or treadle valve to several positions
                    between the fully released and fully applied positions and check the delivered pressure on the test
                    gauges to see that it varies proportionately with the movement of the brake pedal.

                <para count="1">After a full application is released, the reading on test gauges should fall off to zero
                    promptly. It should be noted that the primary system delivery pressure will be about 2 psi greater
                    than the secondary system delivery pressure with both supply reservoirs at the same pressure. This
                    is normal for these valves.

                        mechanical devices, are operating properly. After performing brake work, always check vehicle
                        brakes before returning the vehicle to service.
