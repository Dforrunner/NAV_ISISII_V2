            <para>Press new sleeve bearings in the end cover and crankcase. Ensure that the slot in the bearings lines
                up with the oil passages in the end cover or crankcase. If you have a model with no oil passage present
                in the crankcase, press the sleeve bearing into the crankcase with the slot located 90 degrees from
                vertical.

            <para>Install the front thrust washer with the tang inserted in the slot toward the flange. Insert the
                crankshaft and the rear thrust washer with the tang toward the rear of the compressor.
            </para>
            <para>Place the oil seal ring on the boss of the rear end cover and install the end cover making sure not to
                pinch the seal ring. Ensure the tang of the thrust washer is inserted in the slot of the end cover.
                Fasten the end cover to the crankcase with the four cover capscrews. Tighten the capscrews to 175 to 225
                in-lbs. (19.771 to 25.420 N&#8226;m) in a cross pattern.
