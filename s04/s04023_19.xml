        <title>ANTILOCK OPERATION - GENERAL</title>
        <para>If a service brake application is made and the antilock system finds a beginning wheel lock-up, the
            antilock controller will immediately begin modification of the brake application using the M-21 modulator.
        </para>
        <para>In order to modify the brake application, the coils of the two solenoid valves contained in the M-21 are
            energized or de-energized in a pre-programmed sequence by the ECU. When a solenoid coil is energized, a
            shuttle within the solenoid moves, and depending upon the function of the specific solenoid, it either opens
            or closes, thereby causing the exhaust or re-application of air pressure to the brake actuator. The
            solenoids in the M-21 are controlled independently by the antilock controller. By opening and closing the
            solenoid valves in the M-21 modulators, the antilock controller is able to simulate what the driver does
            when he "pumps the brakes." The antilock controller is able to "pump" each modulator, along with the brakes
            connected to it, independently and with far greater speed and accuracy.
