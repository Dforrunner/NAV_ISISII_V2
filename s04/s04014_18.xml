        <title>COOLING</title>
        <para>The Holset SS 296 and QE air compressor cylinder head is cooled by the engine cooling system, therefore,
            it is recommended that the cooling system be checked regularly.
        </para>
        <para>The following cooling system installation guidelines will provide optimum compressor performance:</para>
        <seqlist>
            <item>
                <para>Water Flow Rate: To provide adequate head cooling, a water flow rate of 4.5 gallons (16.9 liters)
                    plus or minus 1 gallon (3.79 liters) per minute is required at rated engine speeds. Recommended
                    minimum water flow rate through the head is 2.5 gallons (9.46 liters) per minute at rated engine
                    speed with 1:1 compressor drive ratio. Compressor to engine drive ratios higher than 1:1 can require
                    higher coolant flow rates to provide optimum operating life.
                </para>
            </item>
            <item>
                <para>Water Temperature: The engine's cooling water must be sourced immediately after the water pump to
                    provide the lowest temperature water available. Water temperature to the compressor must never
                    exceed 200&#176;F (93&#176;C).
                </para>
            </item>
            <item>
                <para>Water Lines: Inlet and outlet water line size must be .50 inch (12.7 mm) outside diameter (OD)
                    minimum for optimum flow rate. Either water port can be used for inlet or outlet water plumbing.
