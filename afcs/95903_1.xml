                <para>This AFC applies to 3900FC bus chassis with air brakes built from initial production through
                    05/03/1994.
                </para>
                <para>The abovementioned bus chassis were built with 30/30 inch rear double diaphragm spring brake
                    assemblies which meet all FMVSS requirements. Some customers have requested that the brake chambers
                    on the rear of their vehicles be changed from 30/30 inch to 24/30 inch double diaphragm spring brake
                    assemblies to better balance the brake system. This request was mainly associated with short
                    wheelbase buses.
                </para>
                <para>All 3900FC short wheelbase and a few long wheelbase buses were previously retrofit with 24/30 inch
                    double diaphragm spring brake assemblies.
                </para>
                <para>To provide better brake performance, International has decided to replace the 30/30 inch rear
                    double diaphragm spring brake assemblies with 24/30 inch assemblies on 3900FC buses that still have
                    30/30 inch rear double diaphragm spring brake assemblies.
