                <para>Due to engine design changes, which increased the high pressure oil operating pressure, it is
                    possible for oil leakage to become apparent at certain plugs and fittings on the high pressure oil
                    pump. The truck and bus models affected were built between March 1, 2002 and October 15, 2002.

                    pumps charged on a warranty claim will have the Authorized Field Change marked as complete. These
                    customers will not receive an Authorized Field Change notification letter.
