        <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
        <svcprocinfo>
            <para>New vehicles from Chatham, Springfield, Escobedo, and Garland assembly plants are delivered to the
                Consignee (Dealer, body builder or Fleet), by a Carrier. ATC Leasing has a business relationship with
                the three operating companies Active USA, Inc., Active Canada, Inc., and Auto Truck Transport. ATC
                Leasing is responsible for processing transportation loss or damage affecting any vehicle transported by
                one of the operating companies, PROVIDING THE CONSIGNEE RECORDS THE LOSS OR DAMAGE ON THE CARRIER'S
                DELIVERY RECEIPT and PROVIDING THE SHORTAGE OR DAMAGE IS NOT ATTRIBUTED TO ONE OF THE FIVE BILL OF
                LADING EXCEPTIONS: 1) Act of God, 2) Act of the Shipper, 3) Act of the Public Enemy, 4) Act of Public
                Authority, 5) Inherent Vice.
            </para>

            <title>Exceptions</title>
            <para>A copy of the original Bill of Lading from the applicable plant is often found inside the cab. This
                may assist in the receiving process as it may reflect attachments such as radio, spare wheel, etc. The
                Consignee receives and inspects the vehicle, noting any transportation damage and loss (Exceptions) on
                the Carrier's Delivery Receipt (501). Any exception (shortage or damage) must be accurately described on
                the Carrier's Delivery Receipt using the five digit damage coding system. The Carrier representative
                (the driver) and the Consignee (the person receiving the vehicle) both sign the Receipt. A Consignee
                signature on the Receipt with no Exceptions noted, acknowledges all items on the Delivery Receipt are
                accepted; no further action may be taken against the carrier or International. Damage claims for
                corrections not noted on the Delivery Receipt will be denied. The Consignee receives compensation for
                Exceptions by filing a Warranty claim with International Warranty Administration Group (WAG).

            <title>Concealed Damage:</title>
            <para>Damage, due to its location, that cannot be seen during a normal inspection is considered "concealed".
                Typical locations are the oil pan, inside the sidewalls of tires, the bottom side of fuel/air tank, etc.
                CONCEALED DAMAGE MUST BE REPORTED WITHIN 48 HOURS OF DELIVERY, weekends and holidays excluded; THE
                BURDEN OF PROOF IS ON THE CONSIGNEE. The Consignee must file a claim with ATC Leasing; refer to
