        <title>Recording an Exception of Damages or Shortages</title>
        <para>We cannot emphasize too strongly the importance of making a thorough inspection and recording all damages
            and shortages on the carrier's delivery receipt.
        </para>
        <para>Any damage or shortages that can be observed must be noted on the carrier's delivery receipt, form JTC
            501. The carrier's driver or representative must co-sign all copies of the delivery receipt. Claims that are
            supported by a delivery receipt, which differs from the carrier's copy, are subject to charge back by the
            Warranty Claim Center.

            <note>
                <para>****ALL EXCEPTIONS, SIGNATURES, AND DATES ON THE CLAIMANT'S COPY MUST BE IDENTICAL TO THOSE OF THE
                    CARRIER'S COPY. CLAIMS SUBMITTED WITH INSUFFICIENT NOTATION OF DAMAGES ON THE CARRIER FREIGHT BILL
                    WILL NOT BE HONORED.
