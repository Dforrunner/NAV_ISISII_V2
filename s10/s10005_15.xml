        <para>Each Receiving Location must have employees who are familiar with receiving procedures and competent to
            perform inspections. Clean the vehicles as necessary to provide a good view, and inspect as soon after
            receiving as possible. Carrier is responsible for obvious body damages. Trucks not built to spec are not a
            carrier issue.

                <para>TARIFF REGULATIONS PERMIT the Carrier to charge for excessive delay beyond one hour of free
                    waiting time; this hour begins after all the vehicles have been unloaded. Receipt inspection must be
                    performed within this time frame.
