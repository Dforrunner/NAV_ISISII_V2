                <para>New vehicles are lubricated at the factory. After the vehicle is placed in operation, regular
                    lubrication intervals, based on the type of service and road conditions, should be established.
                    Thorough lubrication at the specified intervals will improve the Low Cost of Ownership (LCO) and
                    will reduce overall operating expense.
                </para>
                <para>Choosing an engine oil of correct quality and proper viscosity, and following recommended oil
                    change intervals are essential to Low Cost of Ownership. Using the recommended oil change intervals
                    will result in good engine starting, performance, and long term durability.
                </para>
                <para>The interval between lubrication periods, oil changes, etc. depends entirely upon operating
                    conditions. The loads carried, speed, road and weather conditions all contribute to the frequency of
                    lubrication periods.
                </para>
                <para>In some types of operation, and where operating conditions are extremely severe (such as in deep
                    water, mud or unusually dusty conditions), the vehicle may require lubrication after every
                    twenty-four (24) hours of operation.
                </para>
                <para>Only lubricants of superior quality, such as Fleetrite&#174; lubricants, should be used. The use
                    of inferior products will reduce the service life of the vehicle or result in failure of its
                    components.
                </para>
                <para>Navistar recommends the use of Fleetrite&#174; lubricants.</para>
                <para>The lubrication specifications refer only to the viscosity (SAE) and type to be applied. The
                    viscosity numbers have been adopted by the Society of Automotive Engineers to classify lubricants
                    according to viscosity and do not cover any other properties.
                </para>
                <para>Unless otherwise specified, never add lubricant unless it is the same grade as that which is
                    already in use. If the grade is unknown or not available, drain, flush and refill with new
                    lubricant.
                </para>
                <para>The lubrication intervals specified should be performed at whatever interval occurs first, whether
                    it is months, miles (kilometers) or hours.
