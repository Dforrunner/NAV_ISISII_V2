        <para>Carriers are entitled to recover parts that must be replaced when a vehicle is repaired and a claim is
            filed. These parts must be made available to the carrier as salvage upon request. Numerous parts may be
            requested by the carrier for salvage purposes. These parts may be identified after a claim is processed, the
            Next Day Scrap Report will have "HOLD PARTS" listed and the WPII screen will have an "H" listed for parts
            return. This is an indicator that you should hold the parts and await further instruction on salvage request
            from the carrier.
        </para>
        <para>In order to minimize the length of time a dealer must hold these items, these procedures listed below are

                    is received. If the dealer is not notified within 30 days from the process date of the claim, the
                    parts may be discarded.
