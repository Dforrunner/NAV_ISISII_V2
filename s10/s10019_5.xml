        <title>Description and Operation</title>
        <svcprocinfo>
            <para>Noise is any undesirable sound, usually unpleasant in nature. Vibration is any motion, shaking or
                trembling, that can be felt or seen when an object moves back and forth or up and down. Harshness is a
                ride quality issue where the vehicle's response to the road transmits sharply to the customer. Harshness
                normally describes a firmer than usual response from the suspension system. Noise, vibration and
                harshness (NVH) is a term used to describe these conditions, which result in varying degrees of
                dissatisfaction. Although, a certain level of NVH caused by road and environmental conditions is normal.
                This section is designed to aid in the diagnosis, testing and repair of NVH concerns.

            <title>Acceptable Noise, Vibration and Harshness</title>
            <para>All internal combustion engines and drivelines produce some noise and vibration; operating in a real
                world environment adds noise that is not subject to control. Vibration isolators, mufflers and dampers
                reduce these to acceptable levels. A driver who is unfamiliar with a vehicle can think that some sounds
                are abnormal when actually the sounds are normal for the vehicle type. As a technician, it is very
                important to be familiar with vehicle features and know how they relate to NVH concerns and their
                diagnosis.
