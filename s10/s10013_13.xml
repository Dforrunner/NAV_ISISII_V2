        <title>Aero Packages</title>
        <para>With the advent of trucks with aerodynamics, it is very important that units with aero packages be
            received properly. If a unit is received without the aero package, the delivering carrier's terminal should
            be contacted. If their records indicate a package was shipped with the unit, the package should be obtained
            from the Parts Distribution Center and a shortage claim submitted to the Warranty Claim Center.
        </para>
        <para>If the wrong size package is received, the delivering carrier's terminal should be contacted and advised
            of the error. The receiving location will be directed to return the incorrect package freight collect to the
            carrier. It will be the responsibility of the carrier to get the correct package to the dealer as soon as
            possible.
