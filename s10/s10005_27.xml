        </para>
        <para>ONLY ERRORS AND DEFICIENCIES INVOLVING COMPLETE CODES and items appearing on pages 1 and 2 of the
            submitted order are claimable. Loss and damage claims are to be filed in accordance with provisions of the
            CTS-1100 Warranty Policy Manual.
        </para>
        <para>Before filing a claim, compare the original copy of the order to:</para>
        <para>1. Order entry list received from Customer Response Center (CRC)</para>
        <para>2. Order Content Confirmation Report</para>
        <para>3. Line set ticket of the vehicle.</para>
        <para>If a change/cancellation request is sent by the ordering location and the time period is OUT-OF-POLICY
            with existing change/cancellation policies, no basis for claim exists (even if an attempt to change/cancel
            is made) when the request is not honored.
        </para>
        <para>If the component(s) on the vehicle matches that of the order content confirmation report/order entry list,
            then a problem is a result of not verifying these documents when they were received. There is, then, no
            basis for a claim.
