            <para>The TRW model 410M hydraulic ABS ECU can misinterpret erratic or low amplitude wheel speed signals. If
                the ECU misinterprets these false signals, the TRW ECU may not properly distinguish between an actual
                wheel rotation signal or an erratic errant signal. The ECU may activate the ABS, instead of deactivating
                the ABS in response to a false signal. This may result in the driver experiencing a hard pedal feel and
                a decrease in deceleration at the end of the stop, resulting in extended stopping distance. During the
                described conditions, the ABS warning indicator light may not come on to warn the driver of a system
                malfunction.

                All four ABS wheel speed sensors must be pushed in on all vehicles in this recall. After this procedure
                has been performed, the vehicle must be test-driven. If the ABS warning light comes on during the test
                drive, further troubleshooting will be required to identify and correct the condition. Some vehicles
                that have been exposed to road salts or extreme moisture may have developed corrosion or rust on the ABS
                tone ring teeth. Tooth profile variation due to severe corrosion on the tone ring may cause a faulty
                signal condition even when there is an adequate air gap between the tone ring and the sensor. If the
                sensor has been pushed in to contact the tone ring and tooth variation seems to be causing a faulty
                signal from the tone ring, the rotor should be replaced. If a rotor is replaced, it must be held at your
                location to be inspected by your Customer Service Engineer (CSE).

                    moving. Sometimes the sensor may only move 0.002 inch. Be careful not to damage the sensor wires.
                    The four sensors can easily be located by following the sensor wires on the axles to the backside of
                    the wheel ends. The sensor wires are the only wires that will go from the axle to the backside of
                    the wheel end. Be careful not to damage the sensor wires. You will find the four sensors on the
                    inner side of each wheel end, two on the front axle and two on the rear axle. Push in all four wheel
                    speed sensors by hand (with your thumb) until they contact the tone ring on the rotor. Sensors fit
                    tightly in the holes and may only move a small amount (0.002 inch), but you should be able to feel
                    them move. It may take a lot of force to push in the sensors, but it should not take any more force
                    than what you can apply by hand. Do not strike or pound on the sensor with any type of tool.

                    corrosion, chafed sensor wire(s), poor electrical connections in the ABS or a faulty sensor. If the
                    fault is due to corroded teeth on a tone ring, replace only the rotor that is causing the fault
                    code. Brake pads, calipers and all other non-ABS brake parts are not covered under this recall.
                    Rotors with worn out brake pad surfaces are not covered as well. The above procedure for sensors
