            <para>This defect involves the alignment of the brake pedal with the pressure activated brake switch.
                International was supplied an incorrect brake pedal. This pedal may not activate the brake lights during
                light-pedal-pressure braking. To correct this defect, the correct pedal must be installed on all
                vehicles in this campaign. If the brake lights do not activate properly, the vehicle could be involved
                in a vehicle crash without warning, possibly resulting in
                <emph type="bold">property damage, personal injury, or death</emph>.

                vehicle registration records and the use of such motor vehicle registration data for purposes other than
