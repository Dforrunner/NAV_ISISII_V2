            <para>The park brake assembly was manufactured incorrectly, possibly causing it to not fully engage or

                if the park brake does not fully release, the brake may drag. A vehicle roll-away or dragging park brake

            <para>International Truck and Engine Corporation will notify owners of these vehicles about this campaign. A
                copy of the owner letter is attached. During the recall process, a listing of owner names and addresses
                will be furnished to the involved dealers to enable dealers to follow up with owners and have the
                vehicles corrected. You must limit the use of this listing to this campaign because the list may contain
                information obtained from state motor vehicle registration records and the use of such motor vehicle
                registration data for purposes other than this campaign is a violation of law in several states.
