            <para>Four bolts hold the bunk webbing restraint latch brackets to the bunk base. These bolts were supposed

                this defect will not necessarily result in an accident, the original design intent of the restraint may
                not contain the occupant as required by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulation 393.76 (Sleeper
                Berths) and

                During the recall process, a listing of owner names and addresses will be furnished to the involved
                dealers to enable dealers to follow up with owners and have the vehicles corrected. You must limit the
                use of this listing to this campaign since the list may contain information obtained from state motor
                vehicle registration records and the use of such motor vehicle registration data for purposes other than
                this campaign is a violation of law in several states.
