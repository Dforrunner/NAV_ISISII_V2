            <para>A stand-off bracket that supports the copper air compressor discharge tube was not installed. Normal
                vehicle and engine vibration can cause the unsupported copper tube to fail at or near the air compressor
                connection. A failed compressor discharge tube could deplete the air system and may cause the parking
                brakes to apply. Even though the air pressure gauge and low air pressure warning buzzer would give
                warning, this condition could cause the vehicle to slow down or stop unexpectedly and could cause a
