            <para>IC Corporation has mailed to the affected customers the following notice: "This notice is sent to you
                in accordance with the requirements of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act. IC Corporation
                has decided that a defect, which relates to motor vehicle safety, exists in certain American
                Transportation RE&#8482;, FE&#8482; and CE buses and certain 1552 and 1652-stripped chassis. The
                hydraulic brake master cylinder may have been damaged during the fill and bleed procedure. This damage
                can cause brake drag, brake lock-up or extended stopping distance. This could cause a crash, possibly
                resulting in property damage, personal injury or death and is considered a safety issue."

            <para>Because of our supplier's incorrect routing of hoses on our evacuation and fill machine, the master
                cylinder on these subject vehicles may have been damaged during the fill and bleed procedure at the
                Conway manufacturing plant. The damage is not visible without disassembly and in most cases has not
                affected normal brake operation.

                built from July 9, 2002 through November 26, 2002. The affected 1652 model stripped chassis were built
                from July 9, 2002 through October 15, 2002. The affected 1552 model stripped chassis were built from
                August 29, 2002 through October 15, 2002.
