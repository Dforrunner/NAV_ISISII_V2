            <para>This Recall applies to 3800 and AmTran FE bus models built 8/12/97 through 09/27/99 with air ABS, air
                suspension, and a left side tail pipe. All models will require the same repair procedure, see the
                "Service Procedure" section of this letter.
            </para>
            <para>An air brake line controlling the rear brakes may be too close to the exhaust pipe and may rupture at
                any time without warning under normal driving conditions. Exhaust pipe heat can melt or cause premature
                failure of this air line if the air line is routed too close to the exhaust pipe.
            </para>
            <para>If the air line ruptures, the loss of air pressure in the rear brake system may result in the
                following two conditions: 1. The rear brakes may not actuate when the operator applies pressure to the
                brake pedal (loss of rear brakes) and 2. The rear park brake may automatically apply and cause the
                vehicle to slow or stop until air pressure is restored. A ruptured air line could cause a vehicular
                accident, resulting in possible property damage, personal injury, or death.

                will be furnished to the involved dealers to enable dealers to follow up with owners to have the
                vehicles corrected. You must limit the use of this listing to this campaign since the list may contain
                information obtained from state motor vehicle registration records and the use of such motor vehicle
                registration data for purposes other than this campaign is a violation of law in several states.
