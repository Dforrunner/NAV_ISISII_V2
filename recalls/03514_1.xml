                orange air hoses between the brake treadle valve and primary and secondary air tanks were possibly
                routed incorrectly. If a failure of the primary air circuit occurs with the incorrect hose plumbing,
                depressing the brake pedal will not actuate the brake chambers and could cause a motor vehicle crash
                without warning, possibly resulting in

                During the recall process a listing of owner names and addresses will be furnished to the involved
                dealers to enable dealers to follow up with owners and have the vehicles corrected. You must limit the
                use of this listing to this campaign, because the list may contain information obtained from state motor
                vehicle registration records and the use of such motor vehicle registration data for purposes other than
