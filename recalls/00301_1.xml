        <defect>
            <para>On some AmTran RE&#8482; and AmTran FE&#8482; school buses, the anchor seats were assembled without
                the under floor reinforcement plate on the inboard mounting of the seat to the floor above the fuel
                tank. Past testing of mounting hardware without the reinforcement plate showed the configuration would
                not meet the requirements of FMVSS 210. School buses built with seat belts and without the reinforcement
                are non-compliant to FMVSS 210 and
                <emph type="bold">an accident could result in personal injury.</emph>
                School buses, built in the above time frame with the between the frame rail fuel tank option and 39 inch
                and 45 inch anchor passenger seats (seat belt ready seats), that did not have belts installed by
                American Transportation are also included in this recall.
