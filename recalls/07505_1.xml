            <para>One or both of a suspect vehicle's rear axle housings may contain thinner material than what is
                necessary for normal vehicle operation. Over time, this thinner material may result in a fatigue failure
                of the rear axle housing, possibly in the location of the brake flange. A crack in the brake flange
                location of the rear axle housing may result in a wheel end lockup or wheel separation possibly
                resulting in property damage, personal injury or death.

            <para>The National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act, as amended, provides that each vehicle that is

                after a tender of a vehicle is prima facie evidence of failure to repair within a reasonable time. If
                the condition is not adequately repaired within 60 days, the owner may be entitled to replacement with
                an identical or reasonable equivalent vehicle at no charge, or to a refund of the purchase price less a
                reasonable allowance for depreciation.

            <para>However, consistent with the customer notification, dealers are expected to complete the repairs on
                the mutually agreed upon service date. To avoid having to replace a vehicle or refund the purchase
                price, every effort must be made to promptly schedule an appointment with each owner to repair his or
                her vehicle as soon as possible.
