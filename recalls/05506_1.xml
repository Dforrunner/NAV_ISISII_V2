            <para>During assembly, a spring pin may have been substituted for the cotter pin retainer in the exterior
                locking control of some Canadian CE school buses built with an optional external entrance door control.
            </para>
            <para>The spring pin could slip out of place and jam the operation of the door lever, preventing the door
                from being opened from the outside or inside of the bus. This jamming of the door may occur without
                warning, and may result in an unreasonable risk to motor vehicle safety. This involves evacuation
                concerns relating to people transport.
