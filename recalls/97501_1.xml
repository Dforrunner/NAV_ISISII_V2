                <emph type="bold">with air brakes</emph>
                built from 03/07/1995 through 01/23/1997, and AmTran RS, RC, RE 3000 (rear engine) buses
                <emph type="bold">with hydraulic brakes</emph>
                built from 06/25/1996 through 01/23/1997.
            </para>
            <para>The low pressure return hoses on the power steering system may burst or blow off due to frigid
                temperatures that can cause the steering fluid to become more viscous. If this were to occur on units
                with hydraulic brakes, there would be a sudden loss of power assist on the steering and a reduction of
                brake power assist. On units with air brakes, there would be a loss of power assist on the steering
                only.
                <emph type="bold">This defect could cause a vehicular accident without warning which could result in
                    personal injury or property damage, or both.

            <para>Owners will be notified of this campaign on their vehicles by Navistar. A listing of owner names and
                addresses has been furnished to the involved dealers to enable dealers to follow up with owners to have
                the vehicles corrected. You must limit the use of this listing to this campaign since the list may
                contain information obtained from state motor vehicle registration records and the use of such motor
                vehicle registration data for purposes other than this campaign is a violation of law in several states.
