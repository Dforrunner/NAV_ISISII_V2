            <para>This Recall applies to all models built from 12/23/97 through 8/14/98 with a T 444E diesel engine.
                Engine serial numbers starting with 661894 to 802224.

            <para>The high pressure oil line for the fuel injection system that goes from the high pressure pump to the
                right cylinder head (as viewed from rear of engine) may fail due to rubbing on the charge air cooler
                (CAC) crossover pipe. This contact can eventually wear through the protective loom over the hose causing
                the hose to fail resulting in a sudden loss of oil. If the vehicle is being operated at the time, the
                engine could stall without warning with no ability to re-start which could
                <emph type="bold">cause a vehicular accident and result in person injury, property damage, or both.

            <para>Owners will be notified of this campaign on their vehicles by Navistar. A listing of owner names and
                addresses will have been furnished to the involved dealers to enable dealers to follow up with owners to
                have the vehicles corrected. You must limit the use of this listing to this campaign since the list may
                contain information obtained from state motor vehicle registration records and the use of such motor
                vehicle registration data for purposes other than this campaign is a violation of law in several states.
