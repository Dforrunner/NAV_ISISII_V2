            </para>
            <para>American Transportation Corporation (AmTran) has determined that a defect relating to motor vehicle
                safety exists in some AmTran vehicles in connection with the 5 spoke rear wheel assemblies.

                <title>PROBLEM:</title>
            </para>
            <para>The buses contained in this recall have five-spoke rear wheel assemblies that could have mismatched
                parts. Should the five-spoke rear wheel assembly have mismatched parts, this could cause high stress on
                the wheel studs and potential wheel stud failures. Over a period of time, with multiple stud failures a
                wheel separation could result. This defect could cause a vehicular accident without warning which could
                result in personal injury or property damage, or both.

                not operate any of the vehicles subject to this recall campaign until they have been inspected for the
                presence of the nut assembled to the pinch bolt. In the event that the nut is missing, repairs must be
                made before the vehicle is driven.

            <para>In order to avoid having to replace an owner's vehicle or refund the purchase price, every effort must
