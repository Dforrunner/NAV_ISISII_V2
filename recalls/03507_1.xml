                to be grade 8 bolts but grade 5 bolts were installed in some vehicles. While this defect will not

                5 bolts. In the event of an accident the restraint may not contain the occupant as required by Federal

                During the recall process a listing of owner names and addresses will be furnished to the involved
                dealers to enable dealers to follow up with owners and have the vehicles corrected. You must limit the

                vehicle registration records and the use of such motor vehicle registration data for purposes other than

                    Inspect the bolt heads to determine if the 4 bolts holding the two restraint brackets to the bunk
                    base are grade 5 or grade 8. Grade 5 bolts will have three dashes (lines) on the head of the bolt
                    while grade 8 bolts will have six dashes (see samples of bolt heads in upper left corner of Figure
                    1). There may also be some type of manufacturer identifying symbol on the bolt head; however, it is
                    the dash marks (lines) that must be counted. If all four bolts are grade 8, then the inspection is
                    complete and no replacement is required.

                    The bolts screw into nuts mounted on nut plates (see Figure 1); therefore, replace the grade 5 bolts
                    with grade 8 bolts one at a time so the nut plates will be held in place. The lock washer should be
                    between the head of the bolt and the flat washer as shown in Figure 1. Torque all four bolts to
                    (7.5-9.2 lbf-ft or 90 -110 IN-LBS or 10.2 -.12.5 Nm).
