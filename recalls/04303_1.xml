            <para>IC Corporation has mailed to the affected customers the following notice: This notice is sent to you
                in accordance with the requirements of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act. IC Corporation
                has decided that a defect which relates to motor vehicle safety exists in certain IC CE model school
                buses.
            </para>
            <para>If the Vandal Lock system (interior emergency door locking system) is applied while the engine is
                running, there is no warning to the driver. In the event of an emergency, disengaging the Vandal Lock
                will increase the time to open the emergency exit door and could prevent rapid egress from the bus.
                Preventing rapid egress from the bus could possibly result in personal injury or death.

            <para>The customer was told removal of the Vandal Lock slide bolt guide from the door until the defect is
                remedied will prevent the door from being locked. See picture below. The removal of the guide is
                accomplished by removing the two screws attaching the guide to the door. Retain the screws and guide for
                reinstallation after the defect has been remedied.

            <para>The customer was told your dealer will make this correction for you at no cost. Contact your dealer to
                make the arrangements to repair your unit. If you desire to make this repair yourself, you may purchase
                the parts from the dealer. When you invoice us for the cost of labor, you may add the cost for the parts
                purchased at your dealer. If for some reason you are unable to obtain the replacement parts from your
                local dealer, you may return the "AUTHORIZATION FOR RECALL SERVICE" card with box # 8 checked and we
                will ship the parts directly to you at no charge. Please verify that your shipping address is correct. A
                Post Office Box (P.O. Box) number for shipping is not acceptable. We must have a street or road address.
