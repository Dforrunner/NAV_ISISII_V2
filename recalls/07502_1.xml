            <para>During the recall process, a listing of owner names and addresses will be furnished to the involved

                vehicle registration records and the use of such motor vehicle registration data for purposes other than
                this campaign is a violation of law in several states.

            <para>The National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act, as amended, provides that each vehicle that is
                subject to a vehicle recall campaign must be adequately

                within a reasonable time after the owner has tendered it for repair. A failure to adequately repair

                after a tender of a vehicle is prima facie evidence of failure to repair within a reasonable time. If
                the condition is not adequately repaired within 60 days, the owner may be entitled to replacement with
                an identical or reasonable equivalent vehicle at no charge, or to a refund of the purchase price less a
                reasonable allowance for depreciation.

            <para>However, consistent with the customer notification, dealers are expected to complete the repairs on
                the mutually agreed upon service date. To avoid having to replace a vehicle or refund the purchase
                price, every effort must be made to promptly schedule an appointment with each owner to repair his or
                her vehicle as soon as possible.

            <para>There may be an occasion when a customer was charged for repairs related to this Recall prior to the

                Reimbursement guidelines in Warranty Policy Letter 03-001G. The Warranty Procedures and Administrative
                Policies manual (CTS1100) is in the process of being updated to include the information in Policy Letter
