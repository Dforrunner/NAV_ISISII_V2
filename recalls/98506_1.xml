            <para>Owners will be notified of this campaign on their vehicles by Navistar. A listing of owner names and
                addresses will have been furnished to the involved dealers to enable dealers to follow up with owners to
                have the vehicles corrected. You must limit the use of this listing to this campaign since the list may
                contain information obtained from state motor vehicle registration records and the use of such motor
                vehicle registration data for purposes other than this campaign is a violation of law in several states.
