            <para>Four rear suspension fasteners may not be tightened sufficiently. This hardware connects the main
                support members of the rear suspension to the hanger brackets. This connection could fail by the nuts
                working their way loose or off, or the bolts could break from fatigue. A failure of these fasteners
                could result in separation of the main support from the hanger bracket possibly resulting in a sudden

                During the recall process a listing of owner names and addresses will be furnished to the involved
                dealers to enable dealers to follow up with owners and have the vehicles corrected. You must limit the
                use of this listing to this campaign because the list may contain information obtained from state motor
                vehicle registration records and the use of such motor vehicle registration data for purposes other than
                this campaign is a violation of law in several states.
