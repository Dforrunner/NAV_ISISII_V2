            <para>During the recall process, a listing of owner names and addresses will be furnished to the involved
                dealers to enable dealers to follow up with owners and have the vehicles corrected. You must limit the
                use of this listing to this campaign because the list may contain information obtained from state motor
                vehicle registration records and the use of such motor vehicle registration data for purposes other than
                this campaign is a violation of law in several states.

                            density must be used. GTAW or TIG welding will produce intense radiation, therefore, filter
                            plate lenses of the deepest shade providing adequate visibility are recommended. It is
                            strongly recommended that persons working in the weld area wear flash safety goggles. Also
                            wear protective clothing.

                    mixture of leg types. See photos below. If there are two bolts behind both rear leg posts (toward
                    the rear of the bus as shown in photo 2 below with 4 mounting bolts) the seat is okay. If there is
                    only one bolt behind either leg post (toward the rear of the bus as shown in the photo 1 below with
                    3 mounting bolts), then the seat needs to be repaired.

            <para>The National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act, as amended, provides that each vehicle that is
                subject to a vehicle recall campaign must be adequately

                after a tender of a vehicle is prima facie evidence of failure to repair within a reasonable time. If
                the condition is not adequately repaired within 60 days, the owner may be entitled to replacement with
                an identical or reasonable equivalent vehicle at no charge, or to a refund of the purchase price less a
                reasonable allowance for depreciation.

            <para>However, consistent with the customer notification, dealers are expected to complete the repairs on
                the mutually agreed upon service date. To avoid having to replace a vehicle or refund the purchase
                price, every effort must be made to promptly schedule an appointment with each owner to repair his or
                her vehicle as soon as possible.
