            <para>The brake light switch and the cruise control switch are mounted in such a way as to allow moisture
                within the air brake system to collect inside the switches. Moisture collection within the switches can
                cause the switches to fail prematurely and when the outside temperature drops below freezing the risk of
                failure increases. Moisture in the brake light switch can result in no brake lights to warn other
                vehicles. Moisture in the cruise control switch can result in an extended stopping distance if the
                cruise control does not disengage as expected when the brake pedal is pressed.
                <emph type="bold">Either one of these switch failure modes can cause the vehicle to be involved in an
                    accident which may result in property damage, personal injury, or death.
