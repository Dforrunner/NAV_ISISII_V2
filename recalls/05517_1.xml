            </para>
            <para>VINs were removed from the recall population. Two stop arm manufacturing codes were erroneously
                included in these recalls that designate stop arms that are not Specialty Manufacturing Co. 5-Series
                Electric Stop Arms, and will therefore not require repair.

            <para>The micro switch that controls the stop arm position can malfunction intermittently in operating
                conditions below 32 degrees F. This condition may cause the stop arm to open or close to an improper
                position, or not open at all. Vehicles that include a stop arm switch heater may not have the heater
                wire connected. This condition may result in the same failure mode. This defect could increase the
                likelihood of vehicles passing a stopped school bus and striking pedestrians in the vicinity of the
                stopped bus, which could result in
                <emph type="bold">personal injury or death</emph>.

                    <para>The stop arm serial number is readily visible on the stop arm box once you move and hold the
                        stop sign in an open position away from the stop arm mechanical box. With the battery
                        disconnected, the stop arm can be easily moved away from the mechanical box. With the battery
                        connected, there is more resistance moving the arm, and holding the stop arm in an open position
                        may result in a ratcheting noise, but will not harm the stop arm. Older stop arms will continue
                        to make a noise until the cam shaft is moved (see replacement instructions) or the stop arm is
                        released. Newer stop arms will quit making the noise after a few seconds. If the stop arm has
                        strobe lights, they may flash until the cam shaft is removed (step 2 of replacement
                        instructions).

                you at no charge. International will reimburse you a handling fee when you submit a warranty claim
                (refer to "Warranty Claims" section below). You must provide the VIN of the bus being repaired as well
                as the serial number or numbers of the stop arms to Specialty. Please contact Specialty Manufacturing by
                one of the following methods to obtain a repair kit:
