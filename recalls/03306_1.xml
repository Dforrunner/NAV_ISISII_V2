            </para>
            <para>The original recall letter omitted the repair method with a special condition on the right side
                (entrance door side) modesty panel. The modesty panel at the wall sometimes is too short in height where
                it attaches to the new bracket at the wall. The two guide holes do not line-up with the panel and
                therefore you cannot attach the panel to the bracket. If the modesty panel at this area is not long
                enough in height to match the repair bracket predrilled guide holes, drilling one or two 1/8-inch
                diameter hole(s) closer to the center of the bracket and through the modesty panel to rivet the two
                parts together is permissible. The function of the bracket is to prevent the modesty panel from being
                kicked out of position and the closer location or one fastener will provide this function. Also the
                location of the existing rivets on the wall in the area varies and may interfere with the installation
                of the bracket in the desired position. Putting large diameter flat washers with a 3/16" to &#188;" inch
                hole as a spacer between the supplied bracket and the wall will move the bracket away from the existing
                rivet and provide an approved installation. The picture below shows the method of installing this
                bracket with the two rivets closer to the center of the bracket. If snake rubber is on the panels in the
                area it does not have to be trimmed back to clear the bracket. The rivet when installed will pull the
                panel as tight as needed.

            </para>
            <para>The original recall letter omitted the repair method and parts for a combination of the left modesty
                panel and drivers under seat heater, code 048PLX. The bracket supplied with the kit for this combination
                will not provide the proper repair and should not be used. In place of the bracket supplied with the
                kit, a new bracket part number 2209386C1 must be used. It mounts in a different location using the same
                size mounting hardware supplied with the kit and same size drill. When ordering a kit for units with
                this combination the new bracket must also be ordered. The picture below shows the proper method of
                installing this new bracket. This does not affect the repair of the right side modesty panel.

            <para>IC Corporation has mailed to the affected customers the following notice: This notice is sent to you
                in accordance with the requirements of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act. IC Corporation
                has decided that a defect, which relates to motor vehicle safety, exists in certain American
                Transportation FE&#8482; buses. The Modesty panel mounted under the front seat barriers may be bent out
                of position, exposing a sharp edge. This could cause personal injury and is considered a
                <emph type="bold">safety issue</emph>.

            <para>The affected FE model buses were built from October 14, 1991 through November 06, 2003. The modesty
                panel is an option and not included on every bus.

            </para>
            <para>The steel modesty panel that is installed under the seat barrier behind the driver seat and behind the
                entrance door is cut out to clear the wheel well. This cutout allows the lower portion of the panel to
                be bent out of position leaving a gap between the wheel-well and the lower edge of the modesty panel at
                the cutout area. The edge of the cut out is protected with snake rubber (protective edging). If the
                snake rubber is knocked off of the edge of the panel, a raw edge is exposed facing down.
