            <para>This Recall applies to 2500, 2600, 8100, 8200, 9600, and 9700 models built from 04/21/1995 through
                05/03/1995 with tractor brake code 04092, without code 04WBN. If the vehicle has code 04WBN, Omit
                Bobtail Proportioning, no repair is necessary.
            </para>
            <para>Bobtail proportioning brake systems were made standard on heavy duty tractor models to provide
                improved brake balance when running in the bobtail mode. Because of a coding error, some 2000, 8000, and
                9000 cabover vehicles may have had a portion of the brake system improperly plumbed, which would affect
                the brakes on the rear axle.
            </para>
            <para>Should the brake system not be properly plumbed, it would be detrimental to the stopping ability, and
                in some cases, controllability of the vehicle because the rear axle brakes of the tractor would not be
                doing their share of the braking. This could result in an accident, causing personal injury or property
                damage.
            </para>
            <para>Additionally, accelerated brake lining and drum wear could result on the tractor front axle and
                trailer wheels.

                addresses has been furnished to the involved dealers to enable dealers to follow up with owners to have
                the vehicles corrected. You must limit the use of this listing to this campaign since the list may
                contain information obtained from state motor vehicle registration records and the use of such motor
                vehicle registration data for purposes other than this campaign is a violation of law in several states.
