            <para>This Recall applies to all RE, 1652, 3400, 3600, 3800 and 4700 models built from 1/2/97 through
                11/7/97 with a T 444E diesel engine. Engine serial numbers involved are 460195 through 634234.
            </para>
            <para>Two fuel supply hoses on the T 444E engine could develop leaks. The fuel hoses involved are from the
                fuel regulator to the left head and the hose from the fuel transfer pump to the regulator. The hose
                fittings may have been over-crimped which could result in excessive stress on the fuel hose wall causing
                the hose to crack and leak. Should a leak occur on a hot engine, there is the possiblity of a fire
                starting under the right circumstances,
                <emph type="bold">which could result in a vehicular accident causing personal injury, property damage,
                    or both.

            <para>Owners will be notified of this campaign on their vehicles by Navistar. A listing of owner names and
                addresses has been furnished to the involved dealers for follow up with owners to have the vehicles
                corrected. You must limit the use of this listing to this campaign since the list may contain
                information obtained from state motor vehicle registration records and the use of such motor vehicle
                registration data for purposes other than this campaign is a violation of law in several states.
