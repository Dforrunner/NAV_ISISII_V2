            </para>
            <para>Handrail mounted on subject vehicles listed above may have insufficient clearance between the modesty
                panel (located at the bottom of the crash barrier) and the handrail located rear inside of the entrance
                door. Also, certain buses equipped with handrails that attach to the wall have a small gap at the
                attachment to the wall. Certain small objects may be caught in these areas such as coat tie strings with
                draw string clips or other objects attached. Should this happen, and the driver does not properly
                observe the person exiting the bus, the person may exit the bus with the string captured. If the door is
                closed and the bus moved, possible death or injury to the exiting passenger may result.
