            <para>On some AmTran RE&#8482; school buses, the rear emergency exit windows with Vandal Lock fail to
                conform to Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) No. 217. These rear emergency exit windows
                supplied with a Vandal Lock system allow the locking mechanism to be partially released. In the partial
                release position, the
                <hotlnk xrefid="f0030401">lock does not provide electrical contact</hotlnk>, and the engine may then be
                started while the rear emergency exit window is still improperly locked.
                <emph type="bold">If the window remains locked during an emergency situation, it could prevent
                    evacuation of the passengers causing personal injury or death.
