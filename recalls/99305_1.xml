            <para>This Recall applies to AmTran RE buses, with the standard 74-inch headroom, built from March 1, 1998
                through April 21, 1999.

            </para>
            <para>American Transportation Corporation (AmTran) has determined that certain AmTran RE&#8482; buses fail
                to conform to Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 217, "Bus Window Retention and Release." This defect
                involves the rear emergency exit window on buses with the standard 74 inch headroom only.
            </para>
            <para>
                <title>PROBLEM:</title>
            </para>
            <para>Some rear emergency exit windows in AmTran RE buses, with 74 inch headroom, do not meet the
                requirement of 41 centimeter (16.1 inches) vertical opening as specified in FMVSS 217. The window is
                hinged at the top, and when fully opened, the frame that surrounds the glass surface reduces the opening
                to 38.8 centimeters (15.3 inches) or 2.2 centimeters (0.9 inch) less than the required height.
            </para>

                <title>OWNER NOTIFICATION</title>
            </para>
            <para>Owners are being notified of this recall and have been directed to contact an AmTran dealer to make
                arrangements for inspection and remedy of the defect.
            </para>
            <specpara>
                <note>
                    <para>TPI has issued a recall # 99-001 (NHTSA # 99E-030) involving some of the same vehicles for
                        other defects with the same window. This recall may supersede TPI's recall # 99-001. Therefore
                        if the unit involved in this recall does not have the correct hinge style as displayed in
                        example
                        <hotlnk xrefid="f9930502">"B"</hotlnk>

                        <hotlnk xrefid="f9930503">"C"</hotlnk>, and has the hinge style as shown in example
                        <hotlnk xrefid="f9930501">"A"</hotlnk>
                        (which has the non-compliant opening), the repair for this recall will negate the need for TPI's
                        recall.
                    </para>
                    <para>When the "AUTHORIZATION FOR RECALL SERVICE" card is returned with box #8 (Replacement
                        Required) checked, we will notify TPI that the same unit on their recall will be repaired by
                        this recall.
