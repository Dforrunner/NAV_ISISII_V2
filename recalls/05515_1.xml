            <para>A longer front hydraulic brake hose, for a large (73mm) hydraulic caliper, may have been substituted

                wheel to rub through the brake hose. A hole in a brake hose can cause a partial loss of braking ability

                vehicle registration records and the use of such motor vehicle registration data for purposes other than
