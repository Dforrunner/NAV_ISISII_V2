            <para>The straight fitting (shown as item 6 in Figure 1 and Figure 2) that connects the double check valve
                to the rear axle brake relay valve may break. With certain forces placed upon the vehicle, the weight of
                the check valve on the fitting can cause the assembly to resonate. The subsequent vibration can cause
                excessive strain levels in the fitting, which could eventually cause a fatigue failure.

            <para>There are two kits that will be used to repair vehicles for this recall. 98% of the vehicles will use
                kit 8900083R91 (bracket kit) and only 2% of the vehicles can use kit 8900084R91 (valve kit). Because
                only 2% of the population must use kit 8900084R91 (valve kit), supply is limited, so please do not order
                any of the valve kits until you reference the PART INFORMATION section of this letter and verify which
                is the correct kit for the vehicle.

                Some of the vehicles that use this kit have a traction control relay valve and there are about 130
                vehicles in this recall that have a plate on top of the valve and do not have the ECU mounted on top of
                them. For these vehicles, four new special bolts must be ordered. Please verify the need before ordering
                these bolts, because there is a limited supply. Four bolts per vehicle with the top plate, PN:
