            <para>Navistar first started using the Axilok wheel nut on 04/16/1996. This new style nut required a longer
                draw key slot in the axle housing end to accommodate the Axilok wheel nut lock tab. The supplier
                inadvertently shipped some older housings built with the shorter draw key slot to Navistar assembly
                plants. The shorter slot could possibly cause the Axilok wheel nut lock tab to fail from cracking caused
                by overloads during assembly followed by fatigue during service.
            </para>
            <para>
                <emph type="bold">Should a wheel nut lock tab fail, the rear wheel assembly could separate from the axle
                    housing. Should this happen, the disengaged wheel assembly could pose a hazard to other users of the
                    roadway and adjacent property. This condition would also affect vehicle stability and control and
                    could cause a vehicle crash without prior warning, possibly resulting in property damage or personal
                    injury.

            <para>Owners will be notified of this campaign on their vehicles by Navistar. A listing of owner names and
                addresses has been furnished to the involved dealers to enable dealers to follow up with owners to have
                the vehicles corrected. You must limit the use of this listing to this campaign since the list may
                contain information obtained from state motor vehicle registration records and the use of such motor
                vehicle registration data for purposes other than this campaign is a violation of law in several states.

                If vehicles have been sold or transferred and you are in receipt of Customer Notification Letters and

            <para>Dealers must correct all vehicles subject to this campaign at no charge to the owner, regardless of
