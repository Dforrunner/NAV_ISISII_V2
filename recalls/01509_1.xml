            <para>There is an electrical defect in the parking brake lever assembly's magnetic proximity sensor that may
                cause the daytime running lights to be off while the vehicle is in motion, which is non-compliant to
                CMVSS 108, paragraph 54. The glass case surrounding the reed switch in the magnetic proximity sensor may
                break causing the reed switch to malfunction. Since the daytime running lights are connected to the
                parking brake light circuit, if the reed switch malfunctions in the closed position, the daytime running
                lights will be off even when the vehicle is in motion. The reed switch malfunction has been corrected
                with a reconfiguration of the circuit board on which the glass case surrounding the reed switch is
                mounted.
            </para>
            <para>To repair this defect, the complete parking brake lever assembly will be replaced. There are two lever
                configurations, a short lever used with manual transmissions and a tall lever used with automatic
                transmissions.
