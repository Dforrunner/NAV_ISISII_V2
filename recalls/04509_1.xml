            <para>The studs used to secure the power steering pump to the engine block can fail, possibly resulting in
                engine oil leakage, complete loss of power steering without warning, and an increase in stopping
                distances. The power steering pump is designed to provide power assist to both the steering system and
                the hydraulic braking system. A disengaged pump may reduce the fluid flow to less than the minimum
                required flow rate to provide full power assist to the brake system with low engine speed.
                <emph type="bold">This defect may cause an increase in both stopping distance and steering wheel efforts
                    during steering and braking maneuvers at slow engine speeds, therefore increasing the possibility of
                    an accident, which could result in property damage, personal injury, or death.
