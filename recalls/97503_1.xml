                pound single axles and 40,000 to 46,000 pound tandems were assembled with mis-matched parts on the wheel
                assemblies. Should the rear six spoke wheel assembly have mis-matched parts, this could cause high

                addresses has been furnished to the involved dealers to enable dealers to follow up with owners to have
                the vehicles corrected. You must limit the use of this listing to this campaign since the list may
                contain information obtained from state motor vehicle registration records and the use of such motor
                vehicle registration data for purposes other than this campaign is a violation of law in several states.
