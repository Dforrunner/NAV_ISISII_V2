                        bracket-kit. This revision letter contains the instructions for both kits because the valve kit
                        inventory should be used to depletion for this bus recall.

                        </emph>
                        We changed the start date for the build date range from 8/12/97 to 3/01/98. All the vehicles
                        built in this time frame were built at the Springfield Assembly Plant and do not need to have
                        this recall performed. They have a different relay valve configuration and do not have the
                        subject fitting as shown in Figure 1. As of 10/24/02, we unmarked the VIN records for those that
                        had not already been inspected for this recall. If a customer has a card for this recall but the
                        VIN record does not now show marked with the campaign, the recall does not need to be performed.
                        A quick visual inspection of the relay valve on the vehicle and comparing it to Figure 1 can
                        easily confirm this.

            <para>The straight fitting (Figure 1, Item 6), that connects the double check valve to the rear axle brake
                relay valve, may break. With certain forces placed upon the vehicle, the weight of the check valve on
                the fitting can cause the assembly to resonate. The subsequent vibration can cause excessive strain
                levels in the fitting, which could eventually cause a fatigue failure.

            <para>If the fitting breaks, the rear service brakes will cease to operate without warning, resulting in an
                extended stopping distance. This situation could cause a vehicular accident, possibly resulting in
                property damage, personal injury or death.

            <para>International Truck and Engine Corporation notified owners of these vehicles about this campaign in
                September 2002. A copy of the owner letter was attached to the original G-02505 letter and is also
                available on ISIS. During the recall process, a listing of owner names and addresses was furnished to
                the involved dealers to enable dealers to follow up with owners and have the vehicles corrected. You
                must limit the use of this listing to this campaign, because the list may contain information obtained
                from state motor vehicle registration records and the use of such motor vehicle registration data for
                purposes other than this campaign is a violation of law in several states.
