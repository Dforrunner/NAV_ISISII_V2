            <para>The front, non-drive axle, cotter keys and spindle nut retainers may not have been installed on
                certain vehicles. The cotter key and spindle nut retainer prevent the spindle nut from loosening and
                thus aid in wheel retention. Because there are no mechanical means for preventing the spindle nut from
                loosening, a wheel-off condition can occur. This may result in a
                <emph type="bold">vehicle crash without warning</emph>
                that can result in

                During the recall process a listing of owner names and addresses will be furnished to the involved
                dealers to enable dealers to follow up with owners and have the vehicles corrected. You must limit the
                use of this listing to this campaign because the list may contain information obtained from state motor
                vehicle registration records and the use of such motor vehicle registration data for purposes other than
                this campaign is a violation of law in several states.
