            <para>When the key is in the 'ON' position, the pre-heater, located in the fuel filter base, is energized.
                If this pre-heater is energized while maintenance is being performed on the fuel filter, diesel fuel
                could ignite within the filter housing. A fire within the fuel filter housing may spread possibly
                resulting in property damage or personal injury.

                dealers to enable dealers to follow up with owners and have the vehicles corrected. You must limit the

                vehicle registration records and the use of such motor vehicle registration data for purposes other than

            <para>The National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act, as amended, provides that each vehicle that is
                subject to a vehicle recall campaign must be adequately

                within a reasonable time after the owner has tendered it for repair. A failure to adequately repair

                <emph type="bold">60 days</emph>
                after a tender of a vehicle is prima facie evidence of failure to repair within a reasonable time. If
                the condition is not adequately repaired within 60 days, the owner may be entitled to replacement with
                an identical or reasonable equivalent vehicle at no charge, or to a refund of the purchase price less a
                reasonable allowance for depreciation.
            </para>
            <para>However, consistent with the customer notification, dealers are expected to complete the repairs on
                the mutually agreed upon service date. To avoid having to replace a vehicle or refund the purchase
                price, every effort must be made to promptly schedule an appointment with each owner to repair his or
                her vehicle as soon as possible.
