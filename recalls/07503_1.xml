            <para>However, consistent with the customer notification, dealers are expected to complete the repairs on
                the mutually agreed upon service date. To avoid having to replace a vehicle or refund the purchase
                price, every effort must be made to promptly schedule an appointment with each owner to repair his or
                her vehicle as soon as possible.

            <para>There may be an occasion when a customer was charged for repairs related to this Recall prior to the
                Recall being released. The customer letter contains a statement for the customer to contact the Dealer
                if they believe they are entitled to reimbursement costs. The Dealer should follow the Customer
                Reimbursement guidelines in Warranty Policy Letter 03-001G. The Warranty Procedures and Administrative
                Policies manual (CTS1100) is in the process of being updated to include the information in Policy Letter
                03-001G.
