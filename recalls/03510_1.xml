            <para>There may be an occasion when a customer was charged for repairs related to this recall prior to the
                recall being released. The customer letter contains a statement for the customer to contact the Dealer
                if they believe they are entitled to reimbursement costs. The Dealer should follow the Customer
                Reimbursement guidelines in Warranty Policy Letter 03-001G. The Warranty Procedures and Administrative
                Policies manual (CTS1100) is in the process of being updated to include the information in Policy Letter
                03-001G.
