            <para>This Recall applies to 3800 model buses with a 100 gallon between-the-rails fuel tank mounted behind
                the rear axle and a 276 inch wheel base built 4/2/98 through 5/6/99.
            </para>
            <para>The ABS ECU interfered with the cross member mounted behind the rear axle and in front of the
                between-the-rails fuel tank. Vehicles may have been built by either eliminating or relocating the cross
                member, or moving the ECU as needed. If the cross member is either missing or relocated, the vehicle may
                not have adequate fuel tank protection. In the event of a vehicular accident, decreased fuel tank
                protection may result in a fuel tank intrusion which may cause fuel leakage leading to increased
                potential for property damage, personal injury, death or all of these.

            <para>Navistar will notify owners of this campaign on their vehicles. A listing of owner names and addresses
                has been furnished to the involved dealers to enable dealers to follow up with owners to have the
                vehicles corrected. You must limit the use of this listing to this campaign since the list may contain
                information obtained from state motor vehicle registration records and the use of such motor vehicle
                registration data for purposes other than this campaign is a violation of law in several states.
