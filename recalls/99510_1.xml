        <defect>
            <para>A section of the sunshade wire harness had insulation that did not meet temperature specifications.
                During the manufacturing process the wire harnesses were run through heat ovens where the defective
                insulation could experience melting. Some harnesses were found to have enough melted insulation to
                expose bare copper and create an electrical short.
            </para>
            <para>If the wire insulation is melted enough to create a short, the potential for a fire exists. This short
                can also open the circuit that controls all the marker and tail lights. If the tail and marker lights go
                out the vehicle could cause an accident, resulting in possible property damage, personal injury, death,
                or all of these.

            <para>Navistar will notify owners of this campaign on their vehicles. A listing of owner names and addresses
                has been furnished to the involved dealers to enable dealers to follow up with owners to have the
                vehicles corrected. You must limit the use of this listing to this campaign since the list may contain
                information obtained from state motor vehicle registration records and the use of such motor vehicle
                registration data for purposes other than this campaign is a violation of law in several states.
