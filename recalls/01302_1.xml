            <para>American Transportation has mailed to the affected customers the following notice. This notice is sent
                to you in accordance with the requirements of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act.
                American Transportation Corporation has determined that a defect which relates to motor vehicle safety
                exists in certain International&#174; and AmTran&#174; RE&#8482; and International and AmTran FE&#8482;
                buses. The heater/defroster switch in these buses may become defective, which in some cases has caused
                the melting of the heater harness connector at the switch terminals or the high-speed wire insulation at
                the connector. Also, some of the units had improper circuit protection size installed in the heater
                defroster circuit. The melting issue and the circuit size error are being considered a
                <emph type="bold">safety issue</emph>.
            </para>
            <para>The heater/defroster switch after extended usage on high speed may become defective and create high
                resistance in the switch. The high resistance may destroy the switch and melt the wiring connector at
                the switch and or the high-speed wire insulation at the connector.
            </para>
            <para>On AmTran RE units built from January 1, 1995 through January 1, 1999, a 30-ampere circuit protection
                was used to protect the heater circuit. A 20-ampere circuit protection should have been used.

                <emph type="bold">Please Note:</emph>The original recall notice number 01302 dated August 2001 must be
                ignored. That notice misdiagnosed the root cause of the melting issue. The customer was told that if
                they received the original recall notice, they are to replace the original recall notice and
                "Authorization for Recall Service" card with this revised issue. If they already received a kit for the
                original notice, they are requested to return the "Authorization for Recall Service" card with box # 2
                checked (Corrections made). If the customer inspected their unit using the original recall and
                determined that no repair was required, we asked them to follow the instructions of this recall.

            <para>The affected AmTran RE model buses were built from January 01, 1995 through April 29, 2001. The
                affected AmTran FE model buses were built from January 01, 1999 through April 29, 2001.

        <ownernote>
            <para>The customer was requested to advise the operators of the subject buses of this defect. If the
                operator detects smoke or the smell of melting wire insulation from the blower control panel, the
                operation of the heater/defroster at high speed should be discontinued until the repair is made. If the
                reduced performance compromises the safe operation of the bus, the bus should be placed out of service
                until the repair is made. Take action to have the defect repaired. Inspect the identified unit per the
                following instructions.

            <title>Inspection Procedure</title>
            <para>The owner was told to make this inspection. If the unit is an FE model built in January of 1999, it
                should be inspected to confirm that it only has one switch on the heater control panel. If it has two
                switches, it is not included in this recall. (The customer could also determine if their FE unit is
                involved in the recall by inspecting the instrument panel. Units with a gray plastic instrument panel
                are included in this recall.) If the unit is not involved in the recall, the customer is requested to
                return the "Authorization for Recall Service" card with box # 1 checked (Inspected - No corrections
                necessary). If your unit is an RE model or an FE model built after January 1999, no inspection is
                required.

            </para>
            <para>The owner was told that they might make this repair or contact their dealer to perform this repair.
            </para>
            <para>We told the customer that if they chose to make this repair, they should complete and return the
                enclosed self-addressed and stamped "AUTHORIZATION FOR RECALL SERVICE" card with box # 8 checked and
                verify that their UPS shipping address is correct. When the card is returned to us with box # 8 checked,
                we will request the heater manufacturer to forward to the customer's attention, a kit and instructions
                to make the repair.
            </para>
            <para>We also told them that if they preferred to have their dealer make this repair, to arrange with the
                dealer for repair on a mutually agreed upon date. The customer was also requested to return the
                "AUTHORIZATION FOR RECALL SERVICE" card with box # 8 checked. The dealer must note on the card his
                shipping address. We will have the kit shipped directly to the dealer. We requested the customer to
                allow sufficient time for the dealer to receive the repair kit.
            </para>
            <para>The repair procedure involves the replacement of the switch and switch harness with a new switch,
                switch harness, relay and relay harness. For the RE units built prior to January 1, 1999, the kit will
                also include a 20-ampere manual circuit breaker. Complete instructions to make the repair are included
                with the kit and no special tools are required.
