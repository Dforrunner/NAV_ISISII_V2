            <para>Dealers involved in the recall process will be furnished a listing of owner names and addresses to
                enable them to follow up with owners and have the vehicles corrected. Use of this listing must be
                limited to this campaign because the list may contain information obtained from state motor vehicle
                registration records and the use of such motor vehicle registration data for purposes other than this
                campaign is a violation of law in several states.

            <para>The National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act, as amended, provides that each vehicle that is
                subject to a vehicle recall campaign must be adequately repaired within a reasonable time after the
                owner has tendered it for repair. A failure to adequately repair within 60 days after a tender of a
                vehicle is prima facie evidence of failure to repair within a reasonable time. If the condition is not
                adequately repaired within 60 days, the owner may be entitled to replacement with an identical or
                reasonable equivalent vehicle at no charge, or to a refund of the purchase price less a reasonable
                allowance for depreciation.
            </para>
            <para>Dealers must correct all vehicles subject to this campaign at no charge to the owner, regardless of
                mileage, age of vehicle, or ownership, from this time forward.
            </para>
            <para>Dealers should proceed immediately to make necessary correction to units in inventory. All inventory
                vehicles subject to this recall campaign must be corrected prior to sale, transfer or delivery. If
                vehicles have been sold or transferred and you are in receipt of Customer Notification Letters and
                Authorization for Recall Service cards for those vehicles, transfer location or customer must be
                notified immediately from your dealer location.
            </para>
            <para>Dealers must make every effort to promptly schedule an appointment with each owner to repair his or
                her vehicle as soon as possible. However, consistent with the customer notification, dealers are
                expected to complete the repairs on the mutually agreed upon service date.

            <para>Export Distributors should proceed immediately to make necessary correction to units in inventory. All
                inventory vehicles subject to this recall campaign must be corrected prior to sale, transfer or

                Letters and Authorization for Recall Service cards for those vehicles, transfer location or customer
                must be notified immediately from your distributor location.
