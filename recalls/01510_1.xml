            </para>
            <para>There are only 121 vehicles that are 4800-4X4 models in this campaign that have front drive axle code
                02064. This build combination requires different tie rod ends than the rest of the vehicles in this
                campaign. This letter is to advise dealers of the new kit number that was created for the 4800-4X4
                models with 02064 front drive axle. The "PARTS INFORMATION" section of the intranet copy of the original
                G-01510 on ISIS has been revised to include this part kit. Now there are two tie rod end kits to pick
                from for this recall.

            <para>All TRW's 20-EDL tie rod ends on International vehicles are being recalled due to the possibility of
                ball stud separation from the ball socket. Some of these vehicles were already recalled in Safety Recall
                00512 for TRW tie rod ends, see the "OWNER NOTIFICATION" section below for explanation.

            <para>International Truck and Engine Corporation will notify owners of these vehicles about this campaign.
                Owners of vehicles in 00512 who did not have the tie rod ends replaced by 8/7/01 will receive
                notification for this campaign and

                Owners who had their vehicles inspected for 00512, without tie rod end replacement must have the tie rod
                ends replaced under this campaign; however, the inspection record for 00512 will stay in the warranty
                system history for these VINS. During the recall process a listing of owner names and addresses will be
                furnished to the involved dealers to enable dealers to follow up with owners and have the vehicles
                corrected. You must limit the use of this listing to this campaign since the list may contain
                information obtained from state motor vehicle registration records and the use of such motor vehicle
                registration data for purposes other than this campaign is a violation of law in several states.

                    always placed or adjusted to be exactly in front of the line scribed on both tires. Toe-in is the
                    amount in fractions of an inch that the front wheels are closer together at the front than at the
                    back (Figure 1).
