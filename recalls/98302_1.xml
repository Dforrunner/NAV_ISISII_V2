            </para>
            <para>American Transportation Corporation (AmTran) has determined that a defect relating to motor vehicle
                safety exists in some AmTran vehicles in connection with the steering system.
            </para>

                <title>PROBLEM:</title>
            </para>
            <para>The adjustable steering column is a two piece assembly with a pinch bolt and nut connecting the upper
                column to the lower column. The lower steering column assembly also uses a pinch bolt and nut at the
                steering gear and is not affected by this recall. The upper pinch bolt and nut is locate in the driver's
                compartment just above the driver's feet. (Reference
                <hotlnk xrefid="f9830201">Figure 1</hotlnk>.) In some cases the nut on this model may not have been
                installed to the upper pinch bolt during the assembly process. If the nut was not installed to the pinch
                bolt, it is possible for the bolt to fall out and cause the lower column to separate from the upper
                column.
                <emph type="bold">If this happens, the operator of the vehicle will lose steering control.</emph>

            <title>INSPECTION AND REPAIR PROCEDURE</title>
            <para>Locate the lower shaft of the steering column, which is covered by a protective boot just below the
                housing under the steering wheel. The pinch bolt and nut are located approximately one inch below the
                joint of the sheet metal column housing and the protective boot. To determine if the nut is installed,
                it is recommended that the protective boot should be lowered from the upper column assembly. Refer to

                        than the bolt on the right side and its length is critical to accommodate the harness clamp.

            <para>The National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act, as amended, provides that each vehicle that is

                within a reasonable time after the owner has tendered it for repair. A failure to adequately repair
