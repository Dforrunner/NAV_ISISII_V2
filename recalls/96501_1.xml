            <para>This Recall applies to 3800, 4700 and 4900 vehicles built from 03/05/1993 through 02/06/1996 with
                front axle codes 02ADC, 02ADD, 02ADL, and 02ADN; hydraulic disc brake code 04040; and front wheel hub
                codes 27DMA, 27DNS and 27DMC.

            </specpara>
            <para>Certain front wheel hubs used with hydraulic disc brakes and hub mounted disc wheels may develop
                cracks at the wheel mounting studs. When mounted to the hub, the disc rotor does not support the hub at
                the wheel studs as does a brake drum. The lack of support causes excessive stress at the wheel studs and
                leads to fatigue cracks.
            </para>
            <para>Should sufficient cracks occur, the hub and wheel may separate from the vehicle without warning.
                Should this occur while the vehicle was in motion, the operator could lose vehicle control and/or the
                separated wheel and hub could strike another vehicle or pedestrian. Each of these scenarios could cause
                an accident resulting in personal injury or property damage or both.

            <para>Owners will be notified of this campaign on their vehicles by Navistar. A listing of owner names and
                addresses has been furnished to the involved dealers to enable dealers to follow up with owners to have
                the vehicles corrected. You must limit the use of this listing to this campaign since the list may
                contain information obtained from state motor vehicle registration records and the use of such motor
                vehicle registration data for purposes other than this campaign is a violation of law in several states.
