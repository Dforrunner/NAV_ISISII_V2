            <para>IC Corporation has mailed to the affected customers the following notice: This notice is sent to you
                in accordance with the requirements of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act. IC Corporation
                has decided that a defect, which relates to motor vehicle safety, exists in certain "CE" (IC) and "FE"
                models. The wrong hydraulic brake drop hoses from the frame to the rear axle brakes may have been
                installed. This defect may cause hose failure and loss of the rear axle brake system, possibly causing a
                motor vehicle crash without warning, potentially resulting in property damage, personal injury or death.
                This is considered a
