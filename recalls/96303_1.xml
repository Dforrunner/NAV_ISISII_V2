            </para>
            <para>Handrail mounted on subject vehicles listed above may have an entanglement hazard located at the
                intersection of the handrail brace and the handrail that is located just inside and to the rear of the
                entrance door. Certain small objects may be caught in these areas such as coat tie strings with draw
                string clips or other objects attached. Should this happen, and the driver does not properly observe the
                person exiting the bus, the person may exit the bus with the string captured. If the door is closed and
                the bus moved, possible death or injury to the exiting passenger may result.

                    Gradually pull the string across all handrail joints and attachment points making an effort to catch
                    the string or nut. Using nut and string, attempt to catch the nut between the handrail and any
                    structure or object near the handrail. A failure has occurred if the string or nut is caught in a
                    crevice or between the handrail and any other surface. In addition to the above, the handrail
                    configuration should be reviewed to determine if large objects such as backpacks and purses can be
                    caught between the rail and any other object or surface.

            <para>Proceed immediately to make necessary correction to units in inventory. As a precaution, you should
                not operate any of the vehicles subject to this recall campaign until they have been inspected for the
                presence of the nut assembled to the pinch bolt. In the event that the nut is missing, repairs must be
                made before the vehicle is driven.

                If vehicles have been sold or transferred and you are in receipt of Customer Notification Letters and
                Authorization for Recall Service cards for those vehicles, transfer location or customer must be
                notified from your dealer location.

            <para>The National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act, as amended, provides that each vehicle that is
                subject to a vehicle recall campaign must be adequately
                <emph type="bold">repaired</emph>
                within a reasonable time after the owner has tendered it for repair. A failure to adequately repair

                <emph type="bold">60 days</emph>
                after a tender of a vehicle is prima facie evidence of failure to repair within a reasonable time. If
                the condition is not adequately repaired within 60 days, the owner may be entitled to

                with an identical or reasonable equivalent vehicle at no charge, or to a

                of the purchase price less a reasonable allowance for depreciation.
            </para>
            <para>In order to avoid having to replace an owner's vehicle or refund the purchase price, every effort must
                be made to promptly schedule an appointment with each owner to repair his or her vehicle as soon as
                possible.
