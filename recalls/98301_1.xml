                <emph type="bold">Problem #1:</emph>
                The fuse or circuit breaker on these vehicles could have inadequate circuit protection size for headlamp
                high beam operation. Operation of the headlamps on high beam could overload the fuse or circuit breaker
                causing the
                <emph type="bold">loss of headlamps</emph>. NOTE: The operation of the headlamps on low beam only does
                not overload this circuit.

                The product graphic located on the chassis fuse panel cover could have 10 ampere specified for circuit
                "F15" (headlamp circuit). It should specify 20 ampere.

                The 20 ampere fuse or 20 ampere circuit breaker on these vehicles could be other than "Type I" 20 ampere
                circuit breaker. We recommend that this be changed to a 20 ampere "Type I" circuit breaker.
