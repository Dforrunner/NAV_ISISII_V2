            <para>The problem is chafing of the ABS sensor wires on rotating parts, which can lead to a false signal
                being sent to the Bendix ABS Electronic Control Unit (ECU). This condition may cause the air ABS ECU to
                exhaust the air at the air brake modulators for one or more of the wheels. The intent of this Safety
                Recall is to inspect the routing and clipping of the ABS wheel speed sensors and replace sensors that
                have wire damage. A vehicle with a damaged sensor wire could experience an extended stopping distance
                without warning when the vehicle is decelerating from 8 to 4 miles per hour. If an extended stopping
                distance occurs
                <emph type="bold">the vehicle could be involved in an accident which could result in property damage,
                    personal injury, or death.

                if a vehicle was built at Springfield within a week before or after 10/1/99, the sensor could have the
                DT connector or the DTM connector (each has a different sensor part number in Table 1). The same applies

                    following descriptions: 1. The DT connector has a seal on the male end of the connector, 2. The DTM
                    connector has the seal built inside the female end of the connector plug and it should not come out
