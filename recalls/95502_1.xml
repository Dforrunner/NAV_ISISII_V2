            <para>Certain Rockwell front drive steer axles were manufactured with improperly machined brake drums. The
                brake drums were machined so that the brake drum is not able to seat fully against the mating hub as
                intended. In some cases, the condition may be detected due to excessive wheel run-out caused by the
                mounting of the wheels against the eccentric brake drum. It is also possible for this condition to go
                undetected by the operator.
            </para>
            <para>Should the condition go undetected, it may cause the wheel mounting nuts to loosen after a period of
                time in service. With continued use, the nuts may completely separate from the wheel mounting studs
                and/or the wheel mounting studs may break and the wheel may separate from the vehicle.
                <emph type="bold">Should this happen, it could result in loss of vehicle control by the operator without
                    prior warning and could result in an accident, causing personal injury or property damage.
                </emph>
            </para>
            <para>Check the front drive steer axle assembly for one of the serial numbers listed in the
                <hotlnk xrefid="t9550201">Serial Number Table</hotlnk>. The serial number tag is either located on the
                bowl side of the housing or the carrier side of the housing. Use caution since it is one of three tags
                on the housing and the only one where the axle assembly serial number begins with the letters NKA.
            </para>
            <para>If the axle assembly serial number
                <emph type="bold">does not match</emph>
                one of the serial numbers listed in the table, the axle is not involved in the recall and no further
                action is required.
            </para>
            <para>If the axle assembly serial number matches one of the above serial numbers, the replacement parts
                listed in Parts Information will be required.
