                    This recall procedure includes instructions for installing a secondary accelerator pedal stop. The
                    kits for the RE buses have the secondary stop built into the accelerator assembly bracket while the
                    kits for the other models use a floor mounted rubber stop. There are three different repair kits
                    with three separate installation procedures. The kit usage is grouped by models as follows.

                            <para>Due to floor variations, it may be necessary to use a hacksaw and cut a small portion
                                off the top of the rubber stop. This is only required if the stop is adjusted as low as
                                possible with the nut adjustment explained in step 4 and the stop is still too high to
                                allow the accelerator to go to the full-throttle position. If cutting is necessary,
                                carefully and slowly make a level cut parallel to the base of the stop, removing only
                                what is necessary to achieve the full throttle position and adjust the stop up so that
                                it just contacts the horizontal portion of the pedal rod as shown in FIGURE 2a.

                            <para>Due to floor variations, it may be necessary to use a hacksaw and cut a small portion
                                off the top of the rubber stop. This is only required if the stop is adjusted as low as
                                possible with the adjusting nut and the stop is still too high to allow the pedal to go
                                to full acceleration. If cutting is necessary, carefully and slowly make a level cut
                                parallel to the base of the stop, removing only what is necessary to achieve the full
                                throttle position. After cutting, adjust the stop up so that it just contacts the
                                horizontal portion of the pedal rod as shown in FIGURE 2a.

                of the three labor operations below. However, there may be a few built at the end of the population that
                already have the secondary stop installed. If you find one, please report the vehicle as inspected and
                no corrections necessary by sending in the card or by filing a warranty claim for 0.2 hours to complete
                the recall.
