            <para>Only eight (8) bolts may have been installed in the brake group mounting to the rear axles of some of
                the above units. The brake group, an assembly that includes the brake shoes, air chambers, slack
                adjusters, and spider, is normally attached to the axle housing with nine (9) bolts. When one or more
                bolts are missing, the structural integrity of the brake group mounting is questionable. This may result
                in a loss of braking ability on the rear axles without warning and may result in
