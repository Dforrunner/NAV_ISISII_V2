        <defect>
            <para>Bendix supplied Antilock Traction Relay Valves were incorrectly assembled. An extra check valve was
                installed which will not allow the traction control system to function properly. The traction control
                system is designed to react to traction problems sensed at speeds less than 25 MPH. When the system
                detects a traction control event, the defective valve can cause the rear brakes to apply without warning
                and cause the vehicle to automatically come to a complete stop or experience complete rear wheel lock-up
                on slippery surfaces. If this happens, the rear brakes will not release until the air system pressure is
                depleted.
                <emph type="bold">An unexpected and uncontrollable application of the rear brakes could cause a
                    vehicular accident, possibly resulting in property damage, personal injury, or death.

                listing of owner names and addresses will be furnished to the involved dealers to enable dealers to
                follow up with owners and have the vehicles corrected. You must limit the use of this listing to this
                campaign since the list may contain information obtained from state motor vehicle registration records
                and the use of such motor vehicle registration data for purposes other than this campaign is a violation
                of law in several states.

                    necessary to remove some air lines and remove the valve from the frame to read the date code. Before
                    removing any air lines drain the air system pressure. The defective valves were built from March 29,
