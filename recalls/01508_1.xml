            <para>There is an electrical defect within the remote power modules. These vehicles were built with the
                ability to add six remote switches per module, which are typically mounted outside the cab and are used
                to turn on and off circuits that perform custom electrical functions. If two or more remote switches are
                actuated ON at the same time or close to the same time, all six of the outputs on the remote power
                module (RPM) will turn on. If two or more remote switches are actuated OFF at the same time or close to
                the same time, all six of the outputs on the remote power module will turn OFF.

            <para>International has no record of how the remote power modules are used on the truck body. However
