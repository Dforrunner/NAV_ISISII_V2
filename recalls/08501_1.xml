            <para>The hood tilt assist cylinder's lower retaining pin may become disabled due to interference between
                the locking clip and the grab handle pocket. Should this occur it could allow the pin to work out of the

            <para>The National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act, as amended, provides that each vehicle that is
                subject to a vehicle recall campaign must be adequately repaired within a reasonable time after the
                owner has tendered it for repair. A failure to adequately repair within 60 days after a tender of a
                vehicle is prima facie evidence of failure to repair within a reasonable time. If the condition is not
                adequately repaired within 60 days, the owner may be entitled to replacement with an identical or
                reasonable equivalent vehicle at no charge, or to a refund of the purchase price less a reasonable
                allowance for depreciation.

            </para>
            <para>Dealers should proceed immediately to make necessary correction to units in inventory. All inventory
                vehicles subject to this recall campaign must be corrected prior to sale, transfer or delivery. If
                vehicles have been sold or transferred and you are in receipt of Customer Notification Letters and
                Authorization for Recall Service cards for those vehicles, transfer location or customer must be

            <para>Dealers must make every effort to promptly schedule an appointment with each owner to repair his or

                Letters and Authorization for Recall Service cards for those vehicles, transfer location or customer
