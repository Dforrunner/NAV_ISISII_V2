            <para>American Transportation has mailed to the affected customers the following notice. This notice is sent
                to you in accordance with the requirements of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act.
                American Transportation Corporation has determined that the accelerator pedal in certain AmTran
                Conventional buses may interfere with the floor mat when the lower end of the accelerator pedal is
                depressed. This condition is considered a
                <emph type="bold">safety issue</emph>
                because it could cause the pedal to stick such that the throttle would remain in partial or full
                position. This could cause an accident, resulting in possible injury or death.
            </para>
            <para>These units with the combination of an I6 engine, plywood floor and driver insulation package can
                decrease the distance from the accelerator pedal to the floor. If the operator depresses the lower
                portion of the accelerator pedal with the toe of his shoe, the pedal will pivot to a vertical position.
                When the pedal is in this position and pushed forward to accelerate, the bottom edge of the pedal could
                interfere with the floor mat and stick, causing the throttle to remain in a partial or full position.
