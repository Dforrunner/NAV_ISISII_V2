            <para>The electrical connector of the injection pressure regulator (IPR) valve on the engine can fill with
                rain water and road debris, possibly causing terminal corrosion that may lead to electrical voltage
                drops. If this occurs, erratic behavior of the IPR valve can cause the engine to shut down, without
                warning while the vehicle is in operation. If an engine shutdown occurs, the vehicle may become stranded
                on a roadway. This may lead to
