            <para>Transverse suspension beam castings were not manufactured to specification and may fracture under
                normal loads. If a casting breaks while in transit, there is the potential for pieces of the casting to
                become projectiles and the beam may come in contact with the road surface causing sparks that could
                ignite a fire. This could result in a

            <para>During the recall process a listing of owner names and addresses will be furnished to the involved
                dealers to enable dealers to follow up with owners and have the vehicles corrected. You must limit the
                use of this listing to this campaign because the list may contain information obtained from state motor
                vehicle registration records and the use of such motor vehicle registration data for purposes other than
                this campaign is a violation of law in several states.
