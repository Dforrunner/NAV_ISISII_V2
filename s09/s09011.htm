    <p>The ProStar&#8482; features a unique, patented, service-friendly tilt-away bumper, which gives mechanics and
        drivers the ability to stand next to the engine without leaning over, or climbing over, the bumper. The
        tilt-away bumper also provides extra room for the mechanic who desires to roll under the front corner of the
        truck on a creeper. The tilt-away bumper rotates on two hinges and is quickly activated by releasing two
        hand-operated latches.</p>
