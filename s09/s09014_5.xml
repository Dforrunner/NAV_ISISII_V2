        <para>The front end consists of the front fenders, made of high impact fiber-reinforced plastic, and the hood,
            made of high-strength composite. The hood is designed with three exterior panels to aid in the ease of
            repair, if needed, a panel can be replaced instead of the entire hood. The hood is mounted with a
            three-point design to minimize stress on the hood. The hood is equipped with a torsion bar system to aid in
            the opening the hood.
        </para>
        <para>An optional driver's side hood hatch assembly is available on 7000 series models. This option provides
            access to various maintenance checks without opening the hood.
