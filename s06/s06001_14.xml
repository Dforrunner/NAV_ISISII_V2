        <title>FULL ROUND YOKE INSPECTION</title>
        <para>Check the yoke lug cross holes with a No-Go Wear Gauge and then use an alignment bar to inspect for damage
            by sliding through both cross holes simultaneously. The alignment bar will identify yoke lugs that have
            taken a set because of excessive torque. The raised metal or distorted lugs can be a cause of premature
            cross and bearing problems.
        </para>
        <para>At this time, clean the cross holes of the yokes on the transmission and axle and inspect with an
            alignment bar gauge as described above.
        </para>
        <para>If after proper cleaning of the cross holes, the alignment bar will not pass through simultaneously, the
            yoke lugs are distorted and the yoke or yokes should be replaced.
        </para>

                <para>Use a journal locator to avoid nicking journal cross trunnions or damaging oil seal slingers.
