        <title>HALF ROUND YOKE INSPECTION</title>
        <para>Check the yoke for cross hole alignment using an alignment gauge. Place the correct bushing in each lug
            ear, allowing a .03 to .06 inch clearance between the tang and the bushing
        </para>
        <para>Assemble bearing straps and bolts, tightening bolts a minimum of 30 ft-lbs. (41 N&#183;m). Insert the
            alignment gauge into one cross hole. If the gauge enters and passes through the opposite cross hole,
            alignment is correct. If the alignment gauge will not enter the opposite cross hole, re-inspect for burrs.
        </para>
        <para>If, after proper cleaning, the alignment gauge still does not pass through both cross holes, the yoke lugs
            are distorted and the yoke should be replaced.
