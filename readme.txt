The setup put an icon called ISIS DVD into a folder called Vehicle Diagnostics, which was placed on your desktop if it did not already exist.

After installing, double-click on ISIS DVD icon to run.

You need Internet Explorer to run.

Internet Explorer 6.0 SP2 or 7.0 is recommended. (Earlier versions may not be supported)


You also need to have Windows Scripting Host installed.

An ActiveX control called ActiveCGM is used.
 
The control will be automatically loaded the first time you view a graphic if the latest version is not found on the PC.

You will need to have the security set to Medium (or lower) for the control to be loaded.

If the graphics can't be seen then:
   
In Internet Explorer, Go to Tools/Internet Options/Security set to Medium or lower.
 
After the control has been loaded, the security can be set back to whatever you like.
