        <title>WATER PUMP</title>
        <para>The water pump circulates coolant through the engine block water jackets and cylinder head(s), where it
            accumulates heat. Once the coolant is hot enough to open the thermostat, it flows through the radiator,
            where it is cooled by air blowing through the radiator fins.
        </para>
        <para>Air trapped in the cooling system hastens corrosion of its components. Air expands more than water heated
            to the same temperature. This differential can cause coolant loss by expansion, through the overflow pipe.
            More important, trapped air can cause the water pump to lose its prime, which will stop the flow of coolant.
        </para>
        <para>If coolant flow stops for even a short time, the engine will be in immediate danger of overheating. When
            the engine is operating at normal speeds, the piston rings can scuff, score or seize in a short period of
            time if the coolant flow stops. Coolant in the water jacket which is not circulating can boil at points of
            maximum heat transfer, which forces coolant out the overflow tube and causes the metal at the heat transfer
            points to overheat. This overheated condition destroys the film of lubricating oil in the cylinders, and
            expands the pistons, causing scoring. If the overheated condition is not immediately noticed, the engine
            will be severely damaged.
        </para>
        <para>Damage from overheating shortens engine service life and causes high oil consumption, piston scoring and
            blow-by, especially on high mileage engines: 200,000 to 400,000 miles (320,000 to 640,000 km).
