                <para>The radiator in the 7000 series chassis is mounted above the frame rail to allow for increased
                    ground clearance and for the accessibility of front mounted options, without interfering with the
                    cooling system components.
                </para>
                <para>The 7000 series procedures vary based on the build date of the specific chassis. Refer to the
                    S09007 service manual for the specific information on build dates and hood and component removal
                    procedures.

                    <note>
                        <para>It is also possible to remove the radiator assembly in the 7000 Series Models without
                            removing the hood assembly. If this approach is used, heed the following WARNING.

                        <para>To prevent vehicle damage and/or personal injury, use care when removing or installing
                            cooling system components with the hood in the open position. With the hood assembly in the
                            open position, the available space to maneuver components such as the charge air cooler, air
                            conditioning condenser, external transmission cooler (if applicable) and radiator frame and
                            core assembly is limited, making handling of the components difficult.

                <para>The new International Severe Service truck line has initiated a new high life cycle, low
                    maintenance cooling system, with vehicle down time anticipation at an industry low. The design
                    eliminates long periods of down time waiting for radiator cooling component repair.

                    <warning>
                        <para>To prevent vehicle damage, personal injury, or possible death, park the vehicle on a flat
                            level surface. Make sure the engine ignition is in the off position, and the transmission is
                            in neutral or in the park position if the vehicle is equipped with an automatic
                            transmission. Set the parking brake, chock the wheels, and disconnect the batteries at the
                            negative terminal before doing any service procedures on the engine or vehicle.

                    <caution>
                        <para>Protect all open ports in the charge air system during removal and installation. Dirt or
                            foreign particles in charge air cooling piping or cooling system components could cause
                            internal damage to engine parts.

                        <para>The grille assembly must be removed prior to radiator removal. Refer to S09007, HOOD,
                            FENDER AND GRILLE for removal. Hood removal and cooling system components will all be
                            removed utilizing the procedures as outlined in the 7300, 7400, 7500, 7600 and 7700 series
                            chassis section.
