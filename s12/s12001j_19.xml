            <para count="1">Start engine. As air pressure builds up to about 90 psi the clutch will disengage, reducing
                the fan noise. The compressor governor should be adjusted to cut in no lower than 100 psi. Failure to
                maintain 100 psi minimum may result in excessive fan clutch wear and possible damage to the engine, fan
                and radiator.

            <para count="1">Stop the engine. With the key switch in the ON position and 90-120 psi of system air, the
                fan should turn easily by hand. Check for air and water leaks.

            <para count="1">Restart the engine and run at governed RPM until the fan clutch has completed one on-off
                cycle. It may be necessary to block off part of the radiator to achieve enough engine coolant
                temperature to actuate the fan clutch.
