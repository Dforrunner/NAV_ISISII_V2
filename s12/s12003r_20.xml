            <para>Some cooling systems do not drain out completely. Residual amounts of coolant may be trapped in
                "pockets," especially in engine tube bundles used with an oil cooler or a heat exchanger. Residual
                coolant made up of only water and a minimal amount of antifreeze - with or without conditioner - can
                freeze and cause one or more of the tubes to rupture if exposed to freezing temperatures. The resulting
                leak will be difficult to locate, and can allow coolant to mix with engine oil when the engine is put
                back into service.
