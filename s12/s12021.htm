    <p>The purpose of the cooling system is to circulate the coolant, maintain efficient operating temperature, and
        protect system components. About one-third of the energy produced when diesel fuel burns is converted into power
        by the engine. The remaining energy must be disposed of by the exhaust and cooling systems, or the engine
        components will be damaged by excessive heat and contamination.</p>
