            <para count="1">WHEN REPLENISHING THE COOLANT LEVEL, fill the surge tank up to the bottom of the fill tube.
                It is permissible to quickly fill the tank to overflowing. Filling slowly above the bottom of the fill
                tube wastes coolant by taking up the expansion volume in the top of the tank, so that when the engine
                warms up and the coolant expands, excess coolant will drain from the overflow tube.

            <para>If the upper radiator pipe has a vent cock, open it long enough to allow air to escape. Running the
                engine at high idle (with the parking brake set) with the radiator covered, or normal road driving,
                until the engine thermostat has been open for a few minutes will get rid of air pockets.
