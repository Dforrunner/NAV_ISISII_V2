        <para>Adding shutters to the system means that the control system must assure that the shutters are always open
            before the fan is engaged and also open if the A/C compressor head pressure exceeds 250 psi (

        <para>Adding shutters changes the Alarmstat from a 2-pole switch to a 3-pole switch on Caterpillar and Detroit
            Diesel Series 60 engines; 2 Alarmstats are required with Cummins.
        </para>
        <para>When the engine coolant temperature reaches 180&#176; or 194&#176; F, ignition voltage from the third pole
            on the Alarmstat is cut off and closes the shutter solenoid, cutting off the supply of air needed to keep
            the shutters closed. Until the lower set point is reached, the voltage to the shutter solenoid keeps a
            supply of air to the shutters, holding them in the closed position. The shutters are spring loaded to be
            open without air pressure.
