        <title>AIR INDUCTION SYSTEM</title>
        <para>Inspect the air induction system pipes, hoses and clamps a MINIMUM OF ONCE EACH YEAR. Use the following
            guidelines:
        </para>
        <step1>
            <para count="1">Chlorine in the air induction system (from salt deposits) causes the aluminum piping to
                corrode and flake. The aluminum flakes then contaminate the engine.
            </para>
            <para>Disassemble the joints of each aluminum component and inspect for salt deposits. Clean salt build-up
                from the inside of the pipes with a wire brush; wash hoses with a mild detergent solution and dry them
                thoroughly before assembling the components.
            </para>
        </step1>
        <step1>
            <para count="1">Over a period of time, even a very tiny crack in the air intake system will allow in enough
                dust to damage the engine.
            </para>
            <para>When assembling components, carefully inspect the entire air intake system, looking for cracks and
                openings of any size. Use Loctite Make-A-Gasket No. 2, or Superflex&#8482; RTV Silicone to seal pitted
                joints against leakage. Clean up excess material (that could be pulled into the engine) from inside the
                pipe.

                        the engine.
