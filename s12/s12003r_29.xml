        <title>SUPPLEMENTAL COOLANT ADDITIVES (SCA'S)</title>
        <svcprocinfo>
            <para>Supplemental coolant additives (SCA's) are important to insure long diesel engine life. Their primary
                function is to protect the cylinder wall from cavitation erosion (pitting). Secondarily, they bolster
                the anti-corrosion additives in antifreeze.
            </para>
            <para>In order to insure a uniform concentration level of SCA at time of vehicle delivery, International has
                recently started to incorporate the SCA in factory fill antifreeze. A combination of quality water,
                proper percentage of antifreeze and the correct amount of SCA is called FULLY FORMULATED COOLANT.
            </para>
            <para>On or about January 1, 1994, the coolant filter element will be standardized as a four unit service
                filter for all engines, in lieu of the 12 or 15 unit precharge filters that were previously used.
            </para>
            <para>International's "Fleetrite" filters for OEM and service utilize the "DCA4" formulation of SCA. When
                using the "DCA4" additives, concentration should be maintained at 1.2 to 3.0 units per gallon when
                tested with the "DCA4" test kit.
            </para>
            <para>International realizes that some customers prefer "Nalcool" coolant additive. "Nalcool" is completely
                compatible with "DCA4." When using "Nalcool" as the coolant additive, concentration should be maintained
                at 800 to 2400 ppm of nitrite when tested with the "Nalcool" test kit.
            </para>
            <para>SCA levels should be maintained by regular coolant filter changes and/or liquid SCA additions to
                properly maintain the SCA level. Coolant should be tested a minimum of twice a year. When excessive
                coolant loss occurs and coolant is replaced, dilution of the SCA results. If excessive coolant loss is
                suspected, coolant should be tested and adequate SCA added to make up for chemical lost due to dilution.
                <emph type="bold">Low levels of SCA's will result in engine cylinder or cylinder wall cavitation
                    erosion.

            <para>FLEETRITE COOLANT ADDITIVE CONCENTRATION TEST KIT CCR-8-2700</para>
            <para>This kit will test the coolant for additive units providing the best chemical protection. The kit can
                test either DCA or DCA-4 type additives.
            </para>
            <specpara>
                <note>
                    <para>Kits for the old-style borate additives cannot be used for the new style DCA-4 type additive.
                        New Fleetrite coolant filters use DCA-4 type additive- phosphate/molybdate/nitrite-based.
