            <title>UCM Module</title>
            <para>The UCM module is a compact monitor system integrally contained within the system wiring harness which
                is operable in a wide range of temperatures and environmental conditions designed for both first-fit and
                retrofit into buses, trucks, and other industrial vehicles.
            </para>
            <para>Back-pressure is measured with a pressure switch which is mounted in the vicinity of the DPF. A
                stainless steel hose connects the DPF with the pressure switch. In the systems equipped for temperature
                monitoring, temperature is measured via an in-stream thermistor installed at the inlet of the DPF. The
                pressure and temperature (if installed) are measured on a continuous basis monitoring for alarm
                situations.
            </para>
            <para>The UCM contains two low voltage alarm outputs which can be configured to activate warning lights or
                provide other signals to alert the driver and maintenance staff of any potential exhaust system
                problems.
            </para>
            <para>Figure 1 illustrates the externals of the UCM unit followed by a brief description of each
                component.
