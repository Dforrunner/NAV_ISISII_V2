                <para>4000, 8100, 9200, 9300, and 9400 Series models with dual fuel tanks include a new fuel supply line
                    system. The fuel supply lines draw from both tanks simultaneously and the fuel return lines maintain
                    an equal fuel level in both tanks. Maintaining equal fuel levels in both tanks is accomplished
                    through the addition of a splitter tee in the fuel return line. An equalizer hose at the bottom of
                    the tanks is no longer used. Optional shutoff valves are available for the supply line at the tank
                    location to prevent the lines between the tank and fuel filter from draining back into the tank when
                    servicing the fuel filter or other fuel system component.
                </para>
                <para>If retrofitting a vehicle with new fuel tanks, it is important to make sure the tanks are mounted
                    the same distance from the bottom of the tank to the ground. Supply and return fuel lines must be
                    equal to the length of the supply and return fuel lines on the opposite tank. Failure to follow
                    these guidelines will result in an over-flow condition in one tank.
