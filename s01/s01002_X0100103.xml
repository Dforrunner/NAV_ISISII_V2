        <title>BOLT AND TORQUE INFORMATION</title>
        <para>Bolts of high strength material conforming to SAE Grade 8 bolts should be used on all frames. For
            installation of reinforcements, 0.5 inch (13 mm) diameter flange head bolts are recommended. The SAE Grade 8
            bolt is identified by six radial line markings on the head of the bolt.
        </para>
        <para>In bolted joints, the majority of the load is transferred by frictional force or clamping force between
            the members of the joint. The bolts must be properly tightened to develop and maintain the desired clamping
            force. Operation of the joint with loose or improperly tightened bolts can lead to failure of the joint. The
            bolts and nuts should be inspected periodically to insure that proper torque is maintained.
        </para>
        <para>These bolts, 0.5 inch (13 mm) diameter flange head type, should be tightened to 110 to 120 ft-lbs. (149 to
            163 Nm) based on new bolts and nuts lubricated with engine oil. Whenever possible, hold the bolt and tighten
            the nut.
        </para>
        <para>If frame components are aluminum, flange head bolts and nuts, or bolts with hardened flat washers must be
            used. If modification or repair requires replacement of existing bolts with new bolts or bolts of a greater
            length, the old flange head nuts should not be used with new standard bolts.
        </para>
        <para>Careful consideration is given to the number, location and sizes of frame bolt holes in the design of a
            vehicle. The number, location and sizes of additional bolt holes put in the frame subsequent to manufacture
            of the vehicle can adversely affect frame strength. The adverse effect of additional bolt holes can be
            minimized by following the guidelines.
