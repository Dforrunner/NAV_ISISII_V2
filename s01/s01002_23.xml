            <para>Steps 1 and 2 above also apply to the full length "L" reinforcements available from International. All
                of these are the inverted "L" type and are designed for installation on the outside of the sidemember

            <para>This type of reinforcement is recommended for cases of cracking at very low mileage where a web crack
                has extended beyond the range for a flat plate reinforcement but ends short of the bend radius. It is
                also applicable to cases in which the cracking is accompanied by flange buckling.

                    or down so that the flange is on the same side as the damaged area.
