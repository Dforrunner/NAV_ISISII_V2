        <title>FULL LENGTH CHANNEL WELD REPAIR REINFORCEMENTS</title>

            <para>"Full length" channel reinforcements are available through International dealers for most models. The
                actual length, starting location and ending location vary from model to model. Different length
                reinforcements may also be available.

            <para>When applied as a repair reinforcement, these reinforcements
                <emph type="bold">do not</emph>
                increase the load capacity of the vehicle. Their advantage in this case is their availability. A
                disadvantage of this type is that it is likely to affect more of the components which mount to the
                frame. In some cases this disadvantage may be offset by cutting the full length reinforcement to create
                a local reinforcement.
