                <para>Frame straightening should only be performed by a qualified frame alignment facility. Under no
                    circumstance should frame alignment be performed by inexperienced or unqualified service personnel.

        <para>Use of heat is not recommended when straightening heat-treated frame sidemembers. Heat will weaken these
            frame members, consequently, all straightening should be done at room temperature. Add reinforcement per
            section if heat straightening is done.
        </para>
        <para>Frame members which are bent or buckled sufficiently to show cracks or weakness after straightening should
            be replaced or reinforced.
            <emph type="bold">Heat-treated frame members must not be intermixed with non-heat-treated members.</emph>
        </para>
        <para>If one sidemember is to be replaced, the new member must match the former frame member in both
            cross-section and material strength.
