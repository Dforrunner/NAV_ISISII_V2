        <title>IDENTIFICATION OF FRAME RAIL MATERIAL</title>
        <para>International chassis are manufactured with frame rails of different alloy steels and some are
            heat-treated. Each material must be handled in a specific manner to assure maximum service life; therefore,
            the frame material must be determined before attempting repair or modification.
        </para>
        <para>International chassis are presently manufactured with frame rails of:</para>
        <randlist type="bullet">
            <item>
                <para>Mild steel (36,000 PSI yield strength)</para>
            </item>
            <item>
                <para>High strength low alloy (HSLA) steel (50,000, 60,000 and 80,000 PSI yield strength)</para>
            </item>
            <item>
                <para>Heat treated steel (110,000 psi yield strength).</para>
            </item>
        </randlist>
        <para>Each type has different repair procedures. The frame rail material can be determined by inspecting the
            frame and consulting the dealer vehicle linesetting ticket and the sales data book.
        </para>
        <para>Heat-treated rails are marked on the inside of the section with a decal which cautions against welding,
            flame cutting or the addition of holes in critical zones. These practices are restricted for all frame
            rails, however,
            <emph type="bold">heat-treated</emph>
            rails are much more sensitive to these alterations.
