        <title>CORROSION</title>
        <para>If aluminum and steel are allowed to come into direct contact with each other, a galvanic cell can be
            formed. In order for the cell to form, the dissimilar metals must be in direct contact and an electrolyte,
            such as moisture, must be present. Aluminum is anodic with respect to steel and will corrode when in the
            presence of steel. Corrosion of aluminum frame crossmembers will reduce the load carrying capacity of the
            frame member and may eventually lead to the failure of the frame.
        </para>
        <para>To prevent the formation of a galvanic cell, isolation techniques such as non-conductive or barrier type
            spacers or sealers must be used so that the steel and aluminum are not in direct contact.
        </para>
        <para>It is recommended that a sealer, such as Tectyl 400C or equivalent, be painted onto the surface of both
            the aluminum and steel, as well as on the washers under the head of the bolts and nuts.
