            <title>Dual Tires</title>
            <para>Dual tires should be matched using tires of equivalent size. Tires which differ more than 1/4 inch
                (6.35mm) in diameter or 3/4 inch (19.05mm) in circumference should not be mounted on the same dual
                wheel. The larger or less worn tire should be mounted on the outside.

        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Tandem Drive Axles</title>
            <para>When mounting tires on tandem drive axles, follow the same instructions as specified for dual tires.
                However, never install the four largest tires on one driving axle and the four smallest on the other.
                This method of tire mounting will cause high axle lubricant temperatures which may lead to premature
                axle failures.

            <title>Front Wheel Drive, 4x4, 6x6 and 8x6</title>
            <para>Replacement tires must have same rolling radius as original equipment tires to avoid damage to the
                drive train components and to have proper steering effort. Refer to line setting ticket for original
                equipment tire size.
