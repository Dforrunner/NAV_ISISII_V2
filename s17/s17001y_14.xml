        <title>DYNAMIC BALANCING</title>
        <para>Dynamic balancing is the complete wheel balancing procedure of which static balancing is only a part.
        </para>
        <para>Dynamic balancing (in motion) takes into consideration the distribution of weight to be added to the
            wheel. This is accomplished by rapidly rotating (normal truck operating speed) the wheel and tire assembly
            either on the vehicle or with the wheel assembly removed and placed on a dynamic balancing machine. This
            determines the heavy point on the wheel.
        </para>
        <para>When the amount of weight required to offset a heavy part in a wheel assembly is known, it is sometimes
            necessary to attach one half of the weight to the outside rim flange and the remaining half to the inside
            rim flange.
        </para>
        <para>With the weight properly distributed on the wheel assembly, the wheel should be in balance both statically
            and dynamically and should rotate free of vibration and bounce at normal truck operating speeds.
