            <para>A regular program of tire inspection is essential for the prevention of rapid air loss failures. At a
                minimum, tires should be inspected at the time of the regular preventive maintenance checks.
            </para>
            <para>In any tire inspection routine, tires should be inspected for the lowing conditions. If any are found,
                the tire should be removed and repaired, retreaded or scrapped as the condition indicates.

                    <para>Any blister, bump or raised portion anywhere on the surface of the tire tread or sidewall
                        (other than a bump made by a repair). These indicate the start of internal separation.

            <para>Proper tire inflation, tire loads, and road speeds are important determining factors governing tire
                mileage, and also affect steering ease and maneuverability. How much these factors affect tire wear is
                illustrated in the paragraphs which follow.
