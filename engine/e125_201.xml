        <para>The clutch pedal switch determines driveline disengagement status for manual transmissions. The clutch
            pedal switch is an active component in the "cranking" process ONLY if the customer selected the "clutch
            pedal must be depressed to start the engine" feature. If this feature has been selected, the circuit
            operates as follows:
        </para>
        <step1>
            <para count="1">With the key switch ON, voltage from Crank Inhibit Relay (385) terminal 1 is applied on
                circuit 97L to the normally open (N.O.) clutch switch. The clutch switch is adjusted to be CLOSED while
                the clutch pedal is RELEASED, and OPEN when the clutch pedal is DEPRESSED. With the clutch switch
                closed, 12 volts from Crank Inhibit Relay terminal #1 is applied to ECM terminal 10.
            </para>
            <para>If the ECM sees 12 volts at DDS terminal 10, it determines that the pedal is not depressed, then the
                ECM applies 12 volts to ECM ECI terminal 35, disabling the Crank Inhibit Relay (engine will not crank
                condition). If the clutch pedal is depressed (opening the clutch switch), then 0 volts is present at ECM
                terminal 10, and the ECM switches ECM terminal 35 voltage to 0.1 - 0.6 volts, enabling the Crank Inhibit
                Relay (if all other conditions are OK). The table in the circuit diagram shows terminal voltages for
                various conditions and vehicle configurations.
            </para>
            <para>The Prolink 9000 EST can be used to monitor the Clutch Switch position. When the clutch switch is open
                (clutch depressed), the Prolink indicates clutch ON, meaning the driveline is disengaged.
