        <title>FAULT DETECTION MANAGEMENT</title>
        <para>The VPM has the ability to detect internal fault conditions such as incorrect programming, not ever being
            programmed, wrong configuration of ECM and VPM, corrupted memory and lost memory situations.
        </para>
        <para>External fault conditions, such as loss of DCL/ATA communication, VSS and KAM (Keep Alive Power) circuit
            faults are covered in previous sections of this manual.
        </para>
        <para>Management of a VPM detected fault will vary with the severity of the fault. The more severe faults will
            only allow the vehicle to operate in field defaults which will curtail horsepower (normally the lowest
            horsepower rating available in that engine family) and disable customer features, less severe faults will
            only log a code.
