        <title>Fuel Flow</title>
        <para>The fuel pump in the HFCM draws fuel through a fuel line from the fuel tank. The HFCM heats, filters, and
            pressurizes the fuel. Conditioned fuel flows from the HFCM through the supply line to the secondary fuel
            filter assembly.
        </para>
        <para>The secondary fuel filter assembly conditions, maintains system pressure, and deaerates fuel. Fuel flows
            through each fuel line and a banjo bolt connecting the fuel line to the cylinder head. Fuel flows through
            drilled passages in each cylinder head to the fuel injectors. When the fuel injectors are activated, fuel
            flows into three inlets in each injector. Fuel does not return to the fuel supply system from the injectors
            or cylinder heads; this is a deadhead fuel system.
