            <caption>Glow plug system</caption>
        </figure>
        <para>The glow plug system warms the engine cylinders to aid cold engine starting and reduce exhaust emissions
            during warm-up.
        </para>
        <para>The ECM energizes the glow plugs, by energizing the glow plug relay, while monitoring engine coolant
            temperature and atmospheric pressure. Glow plug activation time is increased, if the engine is cold and
            barometric pressure is low (high altitude).
        </para>
        <para>The ECM monitors battery voltage and uses information from its internal barometric pressure sensor and the
            ECT sensor to determine WAIT TO START lamp ON time and the activation of the glow plug relay. The ECM
            controls the WAIT TO START lamp and the glow plug relay separately. The glow plugs are self-limiting and do
            not require cycling on and off. The glow plug relay will cycle on and off repeatedly if system voltage is
            greater than 14.0 volts.
        </para>
        <para>The engine is ready to start when the WAIT TO START lamp is turned off by the ECM. The glow plugs can
            remain on up to 120 seconds while the engine is running to reduce exhaust emissions during engine warm-up.
