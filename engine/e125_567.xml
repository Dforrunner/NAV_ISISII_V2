        <title>CHECK THE CIRCUIT DIAGRAM</title>
        <para>Refer to the circuit diagram for possible clues to the problem. Location and identification of the
            components in the circuit may give some idea of where the problem is.
        </para>
        <para>The circuit diagrams are designed to make it easy to identify common points in circuits. This knowledge
            can help narrow the problem to a specific area. For example, if several circuits fail at the same time,
            check for a common power source or common ground connection (see POWER DISTRIBUTION AND GROUNDS). If part of
            a circuit fails, check the connections between the part that works and the part that doesn't work.
        </para>
        <para>For example, if the low-beam headlights work, but both high-beam lights and the high-beam indicator do not
            work, then the power and ground paths must be good. Since the dimmer switch is the component that switches
            the power to the high-beam headlights, it is the most likely cause of failure.
