            <para>The International&#174; DT 466E and 530E are inline six cylinder, four-cycle, water cooled engines.
                These engines are equipped with a turbocharger, overhead valves, with replaceable valve guides and valve
                seats for both intake and exhaust. The engine is fueled by a direct injection fuel system with
                electronic sensors and Hydraulically actuated Electronically controlled Unit Injectors (HEUI). The
                firing order is 1-5-3-6-2-4.
            </para>
            <para>The crankcase has been specially designed to withstand the loads of diesel engine operation and has
                cast water and oil passages. The crankcase also has replaceable wet type cylinder sleeves. Every main
                bearing web has angled, drilled holes which are fitted with piston jet tubes that direct lube oil, under
                pressure, to the underside of each piston to help dissipate heat.
            </para>
            <para>Throughout this manual, use of the terms left, right, front and rear must be understood to avoid
                confusion when following instructions. The left and right sides of the engine are described when facing
                the flywheel end (rear) of the engine. The front of the engine is the fan drive pulley end.
            </para>
            <para>The crankshaft is forged steel with induction hardened journals and undercut fillets. It is supported
                on seven precision insert bearings. The camshaft is supported on four pre-reamed bushings and is gear
                driven from the crankshaft. The end thrust of the camshaft is controlled by a thrust flange located
                between the front camshaft journal and the cam gear. Valve lifters have roller followers which provide
                excellent camshaft and lifter durability. This helps minimize engine noise.
            </para>
            <para>There are two types of connecting rods used on this engine for model years 2000 through 2003. The
                connecting rods are easily identified by the way the connecting rod caps are secured to the connecting
                rods.

                <item>
                    <para>Powdered metal forged steel connecting rods are secured with bolts that thread into the
                        connecting rod (no nuts used).

            <para>The connecting rod is constructed of forged steel. It is attached to the crankshaft, one per journal.
                The pistons are cast aluminum alloy or steel crown with an aluminum skirt. All pistons are fitted with
                two compression rings and one oil ring. The piston pin is a free floating type, permitting the pin to
                move or float freely in the piston and connecting rod, and is held in place with pin retaining rings.
            </para>
            <para>A gerotor type lube oil pump is mounted to the front cover. The pump is driven directly by the
                crankshaft at engine speed. All models are equipped with an oil cooler. The oil cooler has a single
                spin-on type oil filter. There is also a spin-on type coolant filter. The fuel system has a single
                spin-on type fuel filter and a pre-strainer assembly attached to the fuel filter header. There is no
                external oil piping with the exception of the air compressor, turbocharger and high-pressure pump piping
                to cylinder head.
