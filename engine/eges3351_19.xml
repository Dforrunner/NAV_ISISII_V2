            <title>Coolant Heater (optional)</title>
            <para>An optional coolant heater is available to warm engine coolant fluids in cold weather conditions. The
                coolant heater warms the engine coolant surrounding the cylinders. Warmed engine coolant aids in
                performance and fuel economy during start-up. The coolant heater is located on the left side of the
                engine crankcase, in front of the Electronic Control Module (ECM).

            <title>Thermostat Operation</title>
            <para>The thermostat has two outlets. One directs coolant to the radiator when the engine is at operating
                temperature. The other directs coolant to the water pump until the engine reaches operating temperature.
                The thermostat begins to open at 88 &#176;C (190 &#176;F) and is fully open at 96 &#176;C (205 &#176;F).

            <para>When engine coolant is below the 88 &#176;C (190 &#176;F) the thermostat is closed, blocking flow to
                the radiator. Coolant is forced to flow through a bypass port back to the water pump.

            <para>When coolant temperature reaches the nominal opening temperature (88 &#176;C [190 &#176;F]) the
                thermostat opens allowing some coolant to flow to the radiator. When coolant temperature exceeds 96
                &#176;C (205 &#176;F), the lower seat blocks the bypass port directing full coolant flow to the
                radiator.
