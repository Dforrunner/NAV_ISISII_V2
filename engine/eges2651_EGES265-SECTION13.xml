                <para>The flywheel housing assembly is bolted to the crankcase and supports the starter motor, rear
                    engine support brackets, and crankshaft position sensor. All transmission applications are designed
                    to be mated to one of four flywheel housing assemblies. Although all are similar in design there are
                    some subtle changes to accommodate a variety of transmission applications. The following lists
                    breaks down the various configurations:
