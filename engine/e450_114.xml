            <title>General</title>
            <para>The most common cause of engine failure is dirt. Even though an air cleaner element itself is properly
                serviced there are other areas in the induction system which must be maintained. The importance of
                pressure testing the air induction system cannot be emphasized enough with present-day high speed diesel
                engines. An air induction leak on the suction side, no matter how small, can cause an engine failure and
                must not be tolerated.

            <para>Test for leakage in the air induction system using a manually regulated compressed air supply, 0-15
                psi (0-103 kPa) pressure test gauge.

                        <para>Any leaks found in air induction system could have allowed dirt to enter engine. Dirt
                            entering engine can cause high oil consumption because of badly worn or broken piston rings,
                            excessive blue smoke, turbocharger compressor wheel pitting and erosion. If any leaks are
                            found in the air intake system, you can check the internal condition of the engine by
                            running a crankcase pressure check.
