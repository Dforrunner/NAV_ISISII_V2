            <para>Voltage is an electrical pressure or force that pushes current through a circuit. The pressure is
                measured in Volts and the symbol V (ex., 12V) is used in circuit diagrams. The letter "E" is also used
                for voltage and stands for Electromotive Force. Voltage can be compared to the pressure necessary to
                push water through a metering valve.

            <para>Low voltage to a lamp will cause the lamp to glow dimly. This can be caused by low source voltage
                (discharged battery or low alternator output) or by high circuit resistance resulting from a poor
                connection. Resistance from a poor connection or poor ground is an additional load in the circuit. The
                additional load reduces voltage available to push current through the load device. Before making any
                meter measurements, review the relationship between voltage, current, and resistance (Ohm's law).
