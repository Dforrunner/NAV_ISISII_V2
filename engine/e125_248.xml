            <para>The Navistar engine control system includes an Electronic Control Module (ECM) and an Injector Drive
                Module (IDM). The IDM's primary functions are to supply high current and voltage to power the injectors
                and to electrically "turn on" individual injectors upon command by the ECM. The ECM communicates and
                controls injector timing and fuel quantity and communicates engine position to the IDM to insure correct
                fueling timing, quantity and firing sequence. The IDM is also capable of feeding back or handshaking
                information received from the ECM and of communicating diagnostic information pertinent to injector or
                IDM operation to the ECM. Information is transmitted between the IDM and ECM on three circuits; (CI)
                Cylinder Identification, (FDCS) Fuel Demand Command Signal and (EF) Electronic Feedback.

            <para>
                <emph type="underscr">Cylinder Identification (CI)</emph>
                is the signal from the ECM to the IDM to indicate the beginning of the firing order. This signal is
                generated by the ECM to indicate to the IDM the position of #1 cylinder and synchronize injector firing
                order to engine position. Engine position is detected by the Camshaft Position (CMP) sensor by
                identifying the sync window in the timing disk. (Refer to CMP sensor for complete function)
            </para>
            <para>
                <emph type="underscr">Fuel Demand Command Signal (FDCS)</emph>
                is the signal sent by the ECM to the IDM to indicate the beginning and ending of each injection cycle.
                This precise "On/Off" signal controls the fuel timing and rate by varying the beginning and ending of
                injection.

                <title>Cylinder Identification (CI)</title>When the IDM is powered up, 12 volts is supplied from pin 16
                of the IDM to pin 34 of the ECM. The ECM will "pull down" this 12 volts low to approximately .6 volts
                (the voltage drop across an internal transistor in the ECM). After the ECM has received a sync signal
                from the CMP sensor and can identify the position of cylinder #1, it will toggle CI and allow it to go
                high (12 volts), 180&#176; of camshaft rotation later or 360&#176; of crankshaft rotation the ECM will
                again pull the CI signal low (.6 volts). This indicates to the IDM to initiate the firing sequence
                1-2-7-3 when it receives the high signal and 4-5-6-8 when it receives the low signal. This signal will
                be repeated every camshaft revolution.

                .6 volts (the voltage drop across an internal transistor in the ECM). After the IDM has received the CI
                signal, the ECM will toggle the FDCS signal high and low to indicate to the IDM the beginning and ending
                of injector operation for each cylinder.

                <title>IDM Diagnostics</title>The IDM monitors operation of output circuits during engine operation.
                Output circuits that are shorted or open are detected by the IDM and are subsequently disabled if
                necessary to prevent damage to the output drivers. This will set a fault code. When a fault is detected
                during operation an EF "extension", transfers fault information to the ECM. Not all faults can be
                transferred during engine operation. However, faults are stored in the IDM when they are detected. These
                faults are transmitted during the "Engine Off Tests", as inactive faults.
            </para>
            <para>At start up, the IDM performs a Self Test of internal components to determine if they are operating
                satisfactorily. The IDM compares the signal inputs to determine if the signal voltages are within
                specification, if not a fault code will be set. These faults are also transferred to the ECM on command
                as inactive faults.
