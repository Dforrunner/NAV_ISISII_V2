            <para>The Electronic Control Module (ECM) continuously monitors and detects Out of Range, Rationality, and
                System Faults.
            </para>
            <para>Each Diagnostic Trouble Code has three numbers that identify the source of a malfunction measured or
                monitored electronically. Most Diagnostic Trouble Codes indicate the source and the Failure Mode. The
                Failure Mode identifies one of the following signal readings:

            <para>When the ignition key is ON, the ECM will record and set a Diagnostic Trouble Code if an input signal
                is Out of Range High or Out of Range Low during normal operation. The ECM also monitors the operation of
                systems and determines if systems are In Range. If a system falls outside a predetermined range, the ECM
                will record and set a Diagnostic Trouble Code.
            </para>
            <para>During normal engine operation, the ECM automatically performs several tests to detect Diagnostic
                Trouble Codes. When Diagnostic Trouble Codes are detected, the ECM often executes a DTC management
                strategy to allow continued, though sometimes degraded, vehicle operation.
            </para>
            <para>The ECM also continuously sets Diagnostic Trouble Codes associated with the injection control system,
                an improvement from previous versions that required specific diagnostic tests to access fault codes.

                <title>Event Log</title>
            </para>
            <para>With the engine running, Engine Events are permanently recorded in the ECM; Engine Events can be
                retrieved with the Electronic Service Tool (EST). Standard Engine Events include excessive coolant
                temperature and engine rpm (overspeed). With the engine running, Event Engine Hours are monitored and
                recorded in the ECM. Event Engine Hours include data resulting from overheating (coolant temperature),
                low coolant level, low oil pressure, and operation beyond maximum rpm. This information and odometer /
                hourmeter readings are stored in the ECM memory.
