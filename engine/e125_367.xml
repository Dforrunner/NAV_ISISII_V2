        <title>CRUISE SET/RESUME IN RESUME POSITION</title>
        <para>Momentarily placing this switch in the RESUME position causes the signal from ECM terminal 50 to go
            through the 121 ohm resistor located in the Resistor Block (390) through the RESUME terminal of the
            SET/RESUME switch returning to ECM terminal 39. With the RESUME switch depressed, the voltage drop in this
            circuit (measured between ECM terminals 39 and 50) is expected to be between 700 mV and 810 mV.
            <emph type="bold">A voltage between 700mV and 810mV is the signal the ECM expects to see with the RESUME
                switch depressed.
            </emph>
        </para>
        <para>The Remote PTO SET/RESUME Switch is a normally open (NO) momentary switch that is wired parallel to the
            cab SET/RESUME switch. When the remote SET/RESUME switch is in the RESUME position, the ECM expects to see
            the same signal as when the cab SET/RESUME switch is in the RESUME position (700mV to 810mV).
