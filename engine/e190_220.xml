        <para>The Electronic Control Module is programmed with two shift schedules: The Closed Throttle Mode and the
            Wide Open Throttle Mode.
        </para>
        <step1>
            <para count="1">The Closed Throttle Mode is for situations with moderate engine load. ECM pin 56 will be Low
                (0 volts). This energizes the relay, turning off power to the solenoid, causing the transmission to
                shift at approximately 65% of engine load.
            </para>
        </step1>
        <step1>
            <para count="1">The Wide Open Throttle Mode is for heavy load situations. ECM pin 56 will be High (12
                volts). This de-energizes the relay causing 12 volts to be applied to the solenoid. In this mode, the
                ECM has shift schedules that occur at 80% of engine load.
            </para>
        </step1>
        <para>When the engine is operating at less than the load shift point, ignition voltage is not applied to the
            shift solenoid. When the ECM commands a transmission shift, the relay coil ground is opened by the ECM,
            which de-energizes the relay, turning ON the power to the shift solenoid, causing it to shift.
