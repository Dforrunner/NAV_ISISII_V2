        <title>FUNCTION</title>
        <para>The Navistar engine control system includes an Injection Pressure Regulator (IPR) valve that controls oil
            pressure in the high pressure injection control system which is used to actuate the injectors. The IPR valve
            consists of a solenoid, poppet and spool valve assembly and is mounted in the high pressure oil pump. The
            ECM regulates injection control pressure by controlling the duty cycle or (on/off time) of the injection
            control pressure solenoid. This increase or decrease of 'on/off" time positions a poppet valve and spool
            valve internal to the IPR, which in turn either maintains pressure in the injection control pressure system
            or vents pressure to the oil sump via the front cover. (Refer to Section I ,Engine Control system Overview,
            in this manual for a more complete description of the IPR operation and function.)
