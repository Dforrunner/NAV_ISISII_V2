        <para>The Engine Crank Inhibit relay controls the current to the start relay. Turning the ignition key to the
            start position supplies current to energize the relay at terminal 85. If the engine is not running the ECM
            terminal 46 will enable the relay by supplying a ground circuit to terminal 86 of the relay. Current for the
            start relay is supplied through the neutral safety switch if the transmission is in neutral with an
            automatic transmission to terminal 30. Or if the truck is equipped with a manual transmission, current will
            be supplied to the relay through the clutch switch if the clutch pedal is depressed. With the relay closed
            current can then pass through the relay to terminal 86 to power the start relay.
