            <title>Read Electrical Operation</title>
            <para>Read the electrical operation for the problem circuit and review the circuit diagram. Understanding
                electrical operation and the circuit diagram can narrow the cause of the problem to one component or
                parts the circuit.
            </para>
        </svcsubproc>
        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Check the Circuit Diagram</title>
            <para>See the circuit diagram for possible clues to the problem. Location of specific components in the
                circuit will help identify the source of the problem.
            </para>
            <para>Circuit diagrams are designed to make it easy to identify common points in circuits. This helps to
                narrow the problem to a specific area. For example, if several circuits fail at the same time, check for
                a common power source or common ground connection (see POWER DISTRIBUTION AND GROUNDS). If part of a
                circuit fails, check the connections between the part that works and the part that does not work.
            </para>
            <para>For example, if the low-beam headlights work, but both high-beam lights and the high-beam indicator do
                not work, the power and ground paths must be good. Since the dimmer switch is the component that
                switches the power to the high-beam headlights, it is probably the cause of failure.

            <title>Check the Cause of the Problem</title>
            <para>Diagnosis charts identify many common faults that may occur. Refer to these charts in each section.
                Follow the procedures in the chart until the cause of the problem is located.
            </para>
            <para>If a particular symptom found in the problem circuit is not covered by a diagnosis chart, see

            <para>All testers come in a variety of models and any working model will be adequate for simple tests;
                however, accurate readings are important. Make sure the test meter used is high quality for accurate
                measurements. The Fluke 88&#8482; (DMM) is recommended.
            </para>
            <para>The Fluke 88&#8482; uses very little current. The digital meter has a high impedance (resistance) of
                10 megaohms (10 M&#x2126;).
