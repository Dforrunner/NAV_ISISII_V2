                for the following discussion.
            </para>
            <para>The Navistar engine control system includes an Injection Control Pressure Sensor. The ECM measures the
                signal from the ICP sensor to determine the Injection Control Pressure as the engine is running to
                modulate the Injection Control Pressure Regulator. This is a closed loop function which means the ECM
                continuously monitors and adjusts for ideal Injection Control Pressure determined by operating
                conditions such as load, speed, and temperature.
            </para>
            <para>The ECM monitors the ICP signal to determine if the performance of the hydraulic system is
                satisfactory. During engine operation, if the ECM recognizes that the pressure reading is lower or
                higher than the value that was commanded, the ECM will set a fault code. This strategy is also used
                during the On Demand tests, commanded by the Electronic Service Tool and referred to as the Engine
                Running tests.

            <title>OPERATION</title>
            <para>The Injection Control Pressure Sensor is a variable capacitance sensor that is supplied with a 5 volt
                reference voltage at terminal B by the ECM from terminal 26. The ICP sensor is also supplied with a
                return circuit (ground) at terminal A from ECM terminal 46. The ICP sensor sends a signal from terminal
                C of the sensor to ECM terminal 27.
            </para>
            <para>The ICP signal voltage increases or decreases equally in proportion to an increase or decrease in
                injection control pressure.
