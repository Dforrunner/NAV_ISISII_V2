                <emph type="bold">Thermistor -</emph>Sensor used to determine temperature. A thermistor changes its
                resistance value in relation to temperature change. Increasing temperature results in decreasing
                resistance, decreasing temperature results in increasing resistance. The thermistor in conjunction with
                a current limiting resistor in the ECM forms a voltage divider that provides a voltage signal that
                indicates temperature. Since the top half of the voltage divider is the current limiting resistor and is
                internal to the ECM a thermistor sensor only has two connections; signal return, and ground.
