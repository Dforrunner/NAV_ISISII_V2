        <para>The lubrication system constantly refills the oil reservoir located in the top of the crankcase below the
            oil cooler. The reservoir provides oil for the high-pressure oil pump.
        </para>
        <para>A gear-driven, high-pressure oil pump is mounted on the top rear of the crankcase under the turbocharger.
            The high-pressure oil pump draws oil through a screen from the oil reservoir.
        </para>
        <para>High-pressure oil flows from the high-pressure oil pump to the branch tube assembly, to both case-to-head
            tube assemblies and then to each high-pressure oil rail. High pressure oil from the high-pressure oil rails
            enter the fuel injector oil inlet ports in the top of each fuel injector.
        </para>
        <para>High-pressure oil is used by the fuel injectors to pressurize, inject, and atomize fuel in the cylinders.
            Injection begins when the OPEN coil for each fuel injector is energized. The CLOSE coils are energized to
            end injection. Injector exhaust oil exits through two outlet ports in the top of each injector and drains
            back to the oil pan.
