                <para>To prevent engine damage, tighten fuel cap on fuel filter assembly. The engine will not run
                    without the fuel filter element in place. The fuel filter element is required to open the valve in
                    the fuel return tube assembly, allowing fuel to flow into the filter. This feature protects
                    injectors from contamination if element is not installed.
