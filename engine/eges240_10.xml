        <para>The key feature of Electronic Variable Response Turbocharger (EVRT&#8482;) is actuated vanes in the
            turbine housing. The vanes modify flow characteristics of exhaust gases through the turbine housing. The
            benefit is the ability to control boost pressure needed to accommodate various engine speeds and load
            conditions. An additional benefit is lower emissions.

        </figure>
        <para>The EVRT&#8482; is a closed loop system that uses the Exhaust Back Pressure (EBP) sensor to provide
            feedback to the ECM. The ECM uses the EBP sensor to continuously monitor EBP and adjust the duty cycle to
            the EVRT&#8482; to match engine requirements.

            <caption>EVRT&#8482; control</caption>
        </figure>
        <para>The solenoid receives a pulse width modulated signal from the ECM that indicates the on / off time that
            the control valve is energized. The control valve directs lube oil flow to both sides of the piston in the
            actuator housing. Directing oil to different sides of the piston increases or decreases exhaust back
            pressure.
        </para>
        <para>Actuated vanes are mounted around the inside circumference of the turbine housing. A unison ring links all
            the vanes. When the unison ring moves, all vanes move to the same position. Unison ring movement occurs when
            either side of the actuator piston is pressurized by engine oil.
        </para>
        <para>Exhaust gas flow can be regulated depending on required exhaust back pressure for engine speed and load.
