        <title>ENGINE IDLE SHUTDOWN CONTROL PARAMETERS</title>
        <para>This group of parameters customizes the prolonged engine idle automatic shutdown feature. The purpose of
            this feature is to shut the engine down after a programmable period of idle time has been exceeded. This
            allows fuel conservation, a reduction of engine wear and emissions. Thirty (30.0) seconds before an
            automatic engine shutdown, the operator will be warned via the red Oil / Water Lamp. This lamp will begin
            flashing until the engine is shut down. The operator may over ride the electronics at any time. After an
            engine shutdown occurs, the Oil / Water Lamp will stop flashing and a diagnostic code (324) will be
            recorded. The diagnostic code is recorded to assist in diagnosing possible service complaints of the engine
            shutting down.

        <para>Currently, there are four states of electronic operation. 1. OFF 2. PTO AVAILABLE 3. NO ENGINE LOAD 4.

        <para>This parameter indicates to the on-board electronics if this vehicle has the Idle Shutdown timer
            feature.
        </para>
        <para>OFF: Feature is turned off at all times.</para>
        <para>PTO AVAILABLE: Feature allow prolonged engine idle shutdown only when the engine is in the low idle no
            load condition and PTO operation is off.
        </para>
        <para>NO ENGINE LOAD: Feature allows prolonged engine idle shutdown when the engine is in the low idle no load
            condition.

        </step1>
        <para>This parameter indicates the maximum ambient air temperature that the on-board electronics may shut down a
            prolonged idling engine. This temperature is used to circumvent the shutting down of an engine when it is
            running because the air conditioning may be turned on.

        <para>This parameter indicates the minimum ambient air temperature that the on-board electronics may shut down a
            prolonged idling engine. This temperature is used to circumvent the shutting down of an engine when it is
            running because of cold ambient temperature.

                code can be cleared with the EST service tool.
