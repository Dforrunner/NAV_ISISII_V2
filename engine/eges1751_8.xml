            <caption>HEUI Injector Stages of Operation</caption>
        </figure>
        <para>Some International electronic engines are equipped with Split-Shot injectors. On these injectors, the
            injection cycle is executed in two stages. Some fuel is pre-injected into the combustion chamber to initiate
            combustion, then primary injection takes place. This feature reduces emission levels at light load
            operations. It also reduces light load engine noise.
        </para>
        <para>Both the electrical and the hydraulic portions of the Split-Shot injector operate identically to the
            regular HEUI injector, but the fuel distribution is different.
        </para>
        <para>The barrel and plunger were redesigned and a spill port was incorporated. When injection is initiated, the
            first shot of fuel is pre-injected into the combustion chamber until the spill port of the plunger coincides
            with the slot on the barrel.
        </para>
        <para>At this time some fuel is allowed to return back to the fuel supply port until the spill port slot is
            blocked again by the plunger and the primary injection stroke takes place.
