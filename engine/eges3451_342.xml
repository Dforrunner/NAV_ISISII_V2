                <para>To prevent engine damage, do not substitute fasteners. All original equipment fasteners are
                    hardened and phosphate coated.

        <para>Many conditions affect torque and the results of torque applications. The major purpose in tightening a
            fastener to a specified torque is to obtain a clamping load which exceeds any possible loading imposed on
            parts.
        </para>
        <para>New phosphate coated fasteners do not require oil lubrication during assembly and torque application.
            Reused fasteners (even if originally phosphate coated) do require oil lubrication to threads and under head
            area for correct torque application.
        </para>
        <para>Threads that are dry, excessively rough, battered, or filled with dirt require considerable effort just to
            rotate. Then when the clamping load is developed or the bolt tension is applied, the torque reading mounts
            rapidly (due to thread friction) to the specified torque value. However, the desired bolt tension and
            correct clamping load is not achieved. This condition can lead to failure of the fastener to maintain
            component integrity. The correct bolt tension and clamping effect can never be attained if the fastener is
            dry. Fastener threads must be new condition phosphate coated or have a film of clean lubricant (engine oil)
            to be considered lubricated.
