        <para>The Engine Oil Temperature Sensor is a thermistor type sensor which changes resistance when exposed to
            different oil temperatures.
        </para>
        <para>When the temperature of the oil is decreased the resistance of the thermistor increases which causes the
            signal voltage to increase. As the temperature of the oil is increased, the resistance of the thermistor
            decreases, causing the signal voltage to decrease.
        </para>
        <para>The EOT sensor is supplied a regulated 5 volt reference signal at terminal B from the ECM. A return
            circuit (ground) is supplied at terminal A from the ECM. As the oil temperature increases or decreases, the
            sensor changes resistance and provides the ECM with the oil temperature signal voltage. This signal voltage
            is then read by the ECM to determine the temperature of the oil.
