                for the following discussion.
            </para>
            <para>The Navistar engine control system includes a Injection Pressure Regulator (IPR) valve that controls
                oil pressure in the high pressure injection control system which is used to actuate the injectors. The
                IPR valve consists of a solenoid, poppet and spool valve assembly and is mounted in the high pressure
                oil pump. The ECM regulates injection control pressure by controlling the duty cycle or (on/off time) of
                the injection control pressure solenoid. This increase or decrease of "on/off" time positions a poppet
                valve and spool valve internal to the IPR, which in turn either maintains pressure in the injection
                control pressure system or vents pressure to the oil sump via the front cover. (Refer to Sec. I.2,
                Injection Control Pressure System for a more complete description of the IPR operation and function.)

            <title>OPERATION</title>
            <para>The IPR valve is supplied with voltage at terminal A of the IPR connector when the ignition key is
                turned on thru fuse F5. Control of the injection control system is accomplished by the ECM grounding the
                IPR circuit from terminal B of the IPR valve thru pin #21 of the ECM. Precise control is accomplished by
                varying the pulse width or percentage of "on/off" time of the IPR solenoid. The frequency of the pulse
                width to the IPR is 400 Hz, normal "on/off" times varies from 8% to 50%. A high duty cycle indicates a
                high amount of injection control pressure being commanded, a low duty cycle is an indication of less
                pressure being commanded.
