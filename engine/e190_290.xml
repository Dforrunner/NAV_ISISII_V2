        <para>The Injection Control Pressure System consists of the low pressure oil lubrication system, passages in the
            front cover and reservoir, high pressure oil pump, high pressure oil line as well as the high pressure oil
            rails machined in the cylinder heads. The injection control pressure system also includes the injectors (and
            their sealing "O" rings), the IPR valve (injection pressure regulator valve) and the ICP (injection control
            pressure) sensor and associated wiring.
        </para>
        <para>The function of this system is to develop, maintain and control the high pressure injection control
            pressure to provide the force to actuate the injectors and provide fuel to the engine.
