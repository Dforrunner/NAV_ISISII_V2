        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Read Electrical Operation</title>
            <para>Read the electrical operation for the problem circuit while referring to the circuit diagram. By
                studying the circuit diagram and the electrical operation, enough information about circuit operation
                can be learned to narrow the cause of the problem to one component or portion of the circuit.
            </para>
        </svcsubproc>
        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Check the Circuit Diagram</title>
            <para>Refer to the circuit diagram for possible clues to the problem. Locating and identifying the
                components in the circuit provides some idea of where the problem could be.
            </para>
            <para>The circuit diagrams are designed to make it easy to identify common points in circuits. This
                knowledge can help narrow the problem to a specific area. For example, if several circuits fail at the
                same time, check for a common power source or common ground connection (see POWER DISTRIBUTION AND
                GROUNDS). If part of a circuit fails, check the connections between the part that works and the part
                that does not work.
            </para>
            <para>For example, if the low-beam headlights work, but both high-beam lights and the high-beam indicator do
                not work, then the power and ground paths must be good. Since the dimmer switch is the component that
                switches the power to the high-beam headlights, it is probably the cause of failure.
            </para>
        </svcsubproc>
        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Check for Cause of the Problem</title>
            <para>Diagnosis charts are provided for many of the common faults that may occur. Refer to these charts in
                each section. Follow the procedures in the chart until the cause of the problem is located.
            </para>
            <para>If the particular symptom found in the problem circuit is not covered by a diagnosis chart, refer to
                the general electrical troubleshooting information provided under Electrical Test Equipment in this
                section.

        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Verify that the Repair is Complete</title>
            <para>Operate the system and check that the repair has removed all symptoms, and also that the repair has
                not caused any new symptoms.

            <title>Electrical Test Equipment</title>
            <para>Various electrical testers have been developed over the years. A few of these are basic but necessary
                to perform an electrical diagnosis. These include:
            </para>
            <randlist type="bullet">
                <item>
                    <para>Jumper Wires</para>
                </item>
                <item>
                    <para>Test Lights</para>
                </item>
                <item>
                    <para>Voltmeter</para>
                </item>
                <item>
                    <para>Ohmmeter</para>
                </item>
                <item>
                    <para>Ammeter</para>
                </item>
            </randlist>
            <para>All of these testers come in a variety of models and any working model will be adequate for simple
                tests. However, when the value of a reading obtained using a meter is critical to the diagnostic
                procedure, accuracy becomes important. Make sure any electrical test meter used is of sufficient quality
                and accuracy to make the measurements required in the electrical testing. The Fluke 88&#8482; (DMM) is
                the International&#174; recommended meter and discussions of meter use in this manual will refer to that
                meter.
            </para>
            <para>The Fluke 88&#8482; (DMM) is recommended because it uses very little current to do its measuring. The
                digital meter has a high impedance (resistance) of 10 megaohms (10 M&#x2126;).
