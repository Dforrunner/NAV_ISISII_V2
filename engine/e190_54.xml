            <title>CONTINUOUS MONITOR</title>
            <para>Diagnostics are performed by the Electronic Control Module (ECM) continuously to detect out of range,
                rationality and system faults
            </para>
            <para>During the time that the key is "ON", if an input signal is "Out of Range" meaning the signal is
                either greater or lesser than what the signal range should be during normal operation, the ECM will
                record a "Fault". It will also monitor the operation of systems and will determine if they are working
                within a normal operational range (Rationality fault detection). If the ECM detects that a system falls
                outside a predetermined range, it will record and set a fault code.
            </para>
            <para>During normal engine operation, the ECM automatically performs several tests to detect faults. When it
                has detected a fault, the ECM often invokes a fault management strategy to allow continued, though
                sometimes degraded, vehicle operation.
            </para>
            <para>The ECM can also set codes associated with the injection control system on a continuous basis which is
                an improvement from previous systems in which specific diagnostic tests had to be performed in order to
                get the codes.
            </para>
            <para>A "Fault" is an indication of a malfunction measured or monitored electronically. Sometimes "Faults"
                are referred to as "Codes."
            </para>
            <para>"Codes" are three digit numbers assigned to Faults to indicate the source of the malfunction. Most
                Codes will indicate the source and the "Mode" of failure. The "Failure Mode" will indicate the signal
                reading, IE.; "Out of Range High", "Out of Range Low" or in Range fault.
            </para>
            <para>During operation of the truck with the engine running, the ECM memory will also record "EVENT ENGINE
                HOURS". This feature records if the engine has been operated beyond maximum rpm, over heated (coolant
                temperature), low on coolant and/or experienced low oil pressure.
            </para>
            <para>The standard Engine Events are Overspeed of the engine, referred to as Over RPM and excessive coolant
                temperature. Low oil pressure and low coolant level operation will also be monitored and recorded as
                "EVENT ENGINE HOURS", if the engine is equipped with the optional engine warning/shutdown system.
            </para>
            <para>Engine events logged into the ECM memory are permanent and they can be retrieved with the Electronic
                Service Tool (EST).
