        <title>Front Cover Coolant Flow</title>
        <para>The water pump draws coolant from the radiator through the front cover coolant inlet. Coolant flows from
            the water pump through three passages in the front cover. Two passages (left and right) direct coolant into
            the crankcase coolant jackets (front to rear) to cool the cylinder walls and the cylinder heads. The third
            passage directs coolant through a passage in the crankcase to the oil cooler cover.
        </para>

            <note>
                <para>If an oil cooler seal is damaged, weep holes in the oil filter base allow coolant to seep from the
                    cooler cover.

        <para>Coolant returns through three front cover passages. Returned coolant is directed to the thermostat by the
            front cover. If the engine has reached operating temperature and the thermostat is open, coolant flows to
            the radiator to be cooled. If the thermostat is closed, coolant is returned to the water pump through a
            bypass passage in the front cover.
