        <title>CRUISE SET/RESUME IN SET POSITION</title>
        <para>Momentarily placing this switch in the SET position causes the signal from ECM terminal 50 to go through
            the 680 ohm resistor located in the Resistor Block (390) through the SET terminal of the SET/RESUME switch
            returning to ECM terminal 39. With the SET switch depressed, the voltage drop in this circuit (measured
            between ECM terminals 39 and 50) is expected to be between 2.2 and 3.0 volts.
            <emph type="bold">A voltage between 2.2 and 3.0 volts is the signal the ECM expects to see with the SET
                switch depressed.

        </para>
        <para>The Remote PTO SET/RESUME Switch is a normally open (NO) momentary switch that is wired parallel to the
            cab SET/RESUME switch. When the remote SET switch is in the SET position, the ECM expects to see the same
            signal as when the cab SET switch is in the SET position (2.2 to 3.0 volts).
