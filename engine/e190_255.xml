            time is controlled by the ECM and is a function of engine coolant temperature, barometric pressure and
            battery voltage. "ON" time normally varies between 10 to 120 seconds. The glow plugs are self limiting glow
            plugs and do not require to be cycled on and off. (The glow plug relay will only cycle on and off repeatedly
            when there is a system voltage condition greater than 13.0 volts.)

            been on long enough to crank the engine. It is controlled by the ECM. Wait light on time is a function of
            engine coolant temperature, barometric pressure and battery voltage. "ON" time normally varies between 2 to
            10 seconds. (
