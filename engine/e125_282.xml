                ) for the following discussion.
            </para>
            <para>The Engine Oil Pressure sensor (EOP) is included in Navistar engine control system only when a vehicle
                is equipped with either the Engine Warning or optional Engine Shutdown engine monitoring system.
            </para>
            <para>The ECM measures the EOP signal to monitor the oil pressure during engine operation. If the oil
                pressure drops below 5.0 PSI (34kPa) @ 700 RPM or 10.0 PSI (69 kPa) @ 1400 RPM or 20.0 PSI (138 kPa) @
                2000 RPM, the ECM will illuminate the OIL/WATER WARN light and sound the audible warning alarm. If the
                vehicle is equipped with the Engine Shut down system and the oil pressure drops to 2.0 PSI (14kPa) @ 700
                RPM or 5.0 PSI (34 kPa) @ 1400 RPM or 12.0 PSI (152 kPa) @ 2000 RPM, the ECM will shut the engine off.

        <svcsubproc>
            <title>OPERATION</title>
            <para>The Engine Oil Pressure sensor is a variable capacitance sensor. When pressure is applied to the
                sensor, the capacitance changes in relation to the pressure.
            </para>
            <para>The ECM supplies a regulated 5 volt signal to terminal B of the EOP sensor from terminal 26 of the
                ECM. The EOP sensor is supplied a signal return (ground) at terminal A to terminal 46 of the ECM.
            </para>
            <para>During engine operation, oil pressure acting on the sensor causes the sensor's capacitance to vary
                which changes the incoming 5 volt reference signal in relation to pressure. The sensor's oil pressure
                signal at terminal C is sent to terminal 42 of the ECM. This signal increases equally in proportion to
                an increase in pressure up to a maximum of 38 PSI (262 kPa).
