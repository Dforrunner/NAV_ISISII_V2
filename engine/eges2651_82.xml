                damage, replace the rocker arm. Be sure to inspect the lower half of the rocker arm. The most
                significant wear will occur at this location. Rocker arms may be resused in their original locations if
                the phosphate coating is worn off and the shaft was not replaced.

                    <para>The purpose of the black phosphate coating on the rocker arm is to provide a break-in
                        lubricant between the rocker shaft and rocker arm bore. It is normal to see the black phosphate
                        coatings worn off of the bottom of the lever arm in the shaft and bore contact area. Rocker arms
                        must be labeled and installed in their original locations to maintain the proper wear pattern.
