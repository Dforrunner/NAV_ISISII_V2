            <para>Coolant Temperature Compensation reduces fuel delivery if Engine Coolant Temperature (ECT) is above
                cooling system specifications.
            </para>
            <para>The reduction in fuel delivery begins when ECT reaches approximately 107&#176;C (224.6&#176;F). A
                relatively rapid reduction of 15% will be achieved as the ECT reaches approximately 109&#176;C (229&#176;F).
            </para>
            <para>The red ENGINE lamp will come on when ECT reaches approximately 109&#176;C (228&#176;F). A warning
                buzzer will sound when ECT reaches approximately 112&#176;C (234&#176;F). The engine will shut down when
                the ECT reaches approximately 121&#176;C (250&#176;F), if 3 way protection is disabled.
            </para>
            <para>Fuel reduction is calibrated to a maximum of 40% before standard engine warning or optional
                warning/protection is engaged. If warning or shutdown occurs, a DTC is stored in the ECM memory.

                    <para>Coolant Temperature Compensation may be disabled in emergency vehicles that require 100% power
                        on demand.
