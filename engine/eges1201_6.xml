            <para>The International&#174; T 444E diesel is a four stroke V-8 engine. It features overhead valves and is
                water-cooled and turbocharged. The engine is fueled by a direct injection fuel system with electronic
                sensors and Hydraulically actuated Electronically controlled Unit Injectors (HEUI). It has a
                displacement of 7.3 liters (444 cubic inches).
            </para>
            <para>When viewing the engine from the rear (flywheel end), the right hand bank of cylinders are numbered 1,
                3, 5, and 7. Cylinder number 1 is at the front. The left bank consists of cylinders 2, 4, 6, and 8. In
                this case, cylinder number 2 is at the front. The engines numerical firing sequence is 1-2-7-3-4-5-6-8.
            </para>
            <para>The Electronic Control Module (ECM) monitors and controls engine performance to ensure optimal
                efficiency, and adherence to emissions standards. The ECM is also able to monitor and control vehicle
                features.
            </para>
            <para>The control system is configured as follows:</para>

            </randlist>
            <para>The crankcase has been especially designed to withstand the loads of diesel operation and utilizes a
                four bolt main bearing cap to assure a rigid support for the rotating parts. The crankcase also has
                piston oil cooling jets and their function is to direct oil to the underside of the piston to help
                dissipate heat to the lube oil.
            </para>
            <para>The crankshaft is a five main bearing unit with fore and aft thrust controlled at the rear (Number 5)
                bearing. Connecting rods are of a forged steel construction and are attached to the crankshaft. Two
                connecting rods share each crankpin journal. The piston pin is a free floating type. It permits the pin
                to move or float freely in the piston and connecting rod. The piston pin is held in place with two
                piston pin retaining rings.
            </para>
            <para>The camshaft is supported by five insert-type bearings pressed into the crankcase, and is gear driven
                from the crankshaft. The end thrust of the camshaft is controlled by a thrust flange located between the
                front camshaft journal and the cam gear.
            </para>
            <para>The aluminum-alloy pistons are fitted with two compression rings and one oil ring. The top compression
                is a keystone configuration.
            </para>
            <para>The hydraulic valve lifters minimize engine noise and maintain zero valve lash or tappet clearance.
                This eliminates the need for periodic adjustment of the valve lash. The hydraulic valve lifters have
                roller followers which provide excellent camshaft and lifter durability.
            </para>
            <para>The one piece cylinder heads used on the engine are equipped with a positive valve rotating mechanism
                on both the intake and exhaust valves. This device is called a rotator and it is located at the top of
                each valve spring.
            </para>
            <para>An electrically controlled glow plug system provides outstanding cold weather starting capability. An
                optional block heater is available to warm coolant at extremely cold ambient temperatures below -29&#176;C
                (-20&#176;F).
            </para>
            <para>Some of the features incorporated in this series of engines include a gerotor lube oil pump (driven
                directly by the crankshaft at engine speed), cast water and oil passages in the crankcase and front
                cover, spin-on type lube oil filter, fuel filter/strainer assembly, and spin-on type coolant filter.
