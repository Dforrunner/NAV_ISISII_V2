        <para>The IPR valve is supplied with voltage at terminal A of the IPR connector when the ignition key is turned
            on through the ECM. Control of the injection control system is accomplished by the ECM grounding the IPR
            circuit from terminal B of the IPR valve thru pin #37 of the ECM. Precise control is accomplished by varying
            the pulse width or percentage of "on/off" time of the IPR solenoid. The frequency of the pulse width to the
            IPR is 400 Hz, normal "on/off" times varies from 8% to 60%. A high duty cycle indicates a high amount of
            injection control pressure being commanded, a low duty cycle is an indication of less pressure being
            commanded.
