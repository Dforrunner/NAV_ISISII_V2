                ) for the following discussion.
            </para>
            <para>The Navistar engine control system includes an Engine Oil Temperature (EOT) sensor. The ECM monitors
                engine oil temperature via the EOT sensor signal to control fuel quantity and timing throughout the
                operating range of the engine. The EOT signal allows the ECM to compensate for oil viscosity variations
                due to temperature changes in the operating environment. This insures that adequate power and torque are
                available under all operating conditions.

            <title>OPERATION</title>
            <para>The Engine Oil Temperature Sensor is a thermistor type sensor which changes resistance when exposed to
                different oil temperatures.
            </para>
            <para>When the temperature of the oil is decreased the resistance of the thermistor increases which causes
                the signal voltage to increase. As the temperature of the oil is increased, the resistance of the
                thermistor decreases, causing the signal voltage to decrease.
            </para>
            <para>The EOT sensor is supplied a regulated 5 volt reference signal at terminal B from ECM terminal 14. A
                return circuit (ground) is supplied at terminal A from ECM terminal 46. As the oil temperature increases
                or decreases, the sensor changes resistance and provides the ECM with the oil temperature signal voltage
                at terminal 14. This signal voltage is then read by the ECM to determine the temperature of the oil.
