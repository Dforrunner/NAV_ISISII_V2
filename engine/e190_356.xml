        <para>PTO speed control is to allow an operator to set a fixed engine speed, either in the cab or remotely. In
            cab PTO uses the same switches on the dash as are used for the cruise control. Remote PTO uses switches
            which are installed by a body builder and are wired into the vehicle's wiring harness at the "body builder's
            connections". There are two features that utilize the PTO speed controls. Remote accelerator pedal and
            Hydraulic Pressure Governing. Refer to RPS and HPG in this section of manual.
