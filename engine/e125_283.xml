                for the following discussion.
            </para>
            <para>The ECM continuously monitors the signal from the EOP sensor to ensure the signal is within the
                correct operating range. If the signal is lower or higher than required, the ECM will set a fault code.
                This fault code is retrieved using the Electronic Service Tool (EST) or by reading the flash code using
                the STI diagnostic switch. If the ignition key is shut off, the code will be stored as an inactive code.
            </para>
            <para>During engine operation, the ECM also monitors the engine speed signal. It compares the expected oil
                pressure specification versus engine speed. If the ECM detects that the oil pressure is lower for a
                given engine speed, the ECM will set a fault code. If the pressure is lower than the "critical" level,
                the ECM will record a fault code. The VPM will automatically record this as a low oil pressure "Event"
                which is stored in the VPM memory and cannot be erased using the EST. This becomes a record of operation
                of the engine.

            <title>FLASH CODE 211 - ATA CODE PID 100 FMI 4 - ENGINE OIL PRESS SIGNAL OUT OF RANGE LOW</title>
            <para>An out of range low code will be set if the ECM detects a voltage less than .039 volts for more than
                0.1 seconds. If this fault code is set the ECM will ignore the EOP signal and continue to operate
                normally. However, if the fault is Active, the ECM will turn on the Engine Warning light.
            </para>
            <para>Code 211 may be caused by an open Vref feed, open signal circuit or a defective sensor.</para>

        <svcsubproc>
            <title>FLASH CODE 212 - ATA CODE PID 100 FMI 3 - ENGINE OIL PRESSURE SIGNAL OUT OF RANGE HIGH</title>
            <para>An out of range high code will be set if the ECM detects a voltage more than 4.9 volts for more than
                0.1 seconds. If this fault code is set, the ECM will ignore the EOP signal and continue to operate
                normally. If this fault is active, the ECM will illuminate the Engine Warning light.
            </para>
            <para>Code 212 may be caused by an open signal return circuit, a short to a voltage source or a defective
                sensor.

            <title>FLASH CODE 313 - ATA CODE PID 100 FMI 1 - ENGINE OIL PRESSURE BELOW WARNING LEVEL</title>
            <para>Code 313 indicates that the oil pressure has dropped below the warning level. The specification for
                the warning level is 5.0 PSI (34kPa) @ 700 RPM or 10.0 PSI (69 kPa) @ 1400 RPM or 20.0 PSI (138 kPa) @
                2000 RPM.
            </para>
            <para>Code 313 may be caused by a defective sensor sending an incorrect signal. To confirm this, compare
                actual oil pressure to the reading on the data list of the EST. Low oil pressure due to defective
                mechanical components will also set this code.
            </para>
            <specpara>
                <note>
                    <para>It may be possible to set this code at start-up, especially if the oil was just changed, or
                        after a rebuild until the oil system is primed.

            <title>FLASH CODE 314 - ATA CODE 100 FMI 7 - ENGINE OIL PRESSURE BELOW CRITICAL LEVEL</title>
            <para>If flash code 314 is set, this indicates that the oil pressure has dropped below the critical level.
                The specification for the critical level is 2.0 PSI (14kPa) @ 700 RPM or 5.0 PSI (34 kPa) @ 1400 RPM or
                12.0 PSI (152 kPa) @ 2000 RPM.
            </para>
            <para>Code 314 may be caused by a defective sensor sending an incorrect signal. To confirm this, compare
                actual oil pressure to the reading on the data list of the EST. Low oil pressure due to defective
                mechanical components will also set this code.
