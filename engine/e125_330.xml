                for the following discussion.
            </para>
            <para>The IDM monitors the voltage on the driver circuits and is capable of detecting an open or shorted
                circuit. If the IDM detects a short to ground or a multiple fault in a driver, the IDM will discontinue
                operation of that driver which would cause the engine to operate on the remaining bank of 4 cylinders.
                The IDM will transmit a message to the ECM that a fault has been detected. The ECM will respond by
                illuminating the Engine Warning Light and compensating for inoperative cylinders to keep the engine
                running if mechanically possible.
            </para>
            <para>Faults detected by the IDM will be stored in the IDM and transmitted to the ECM during an "Engine Off
                Standard Test". These faults will be transmitted as Inactive faults. Faults can be retrieved using the
                Electronic Service Tool or the STI Self Test Input Diagnostic Switch located on the vehicle dash.
            </para>
            <specpara>
                <note>
                    <para>The last digit of the flash code indicates the affected cylinder number. For example, CODE 421
                        indicates cylinder No. 1 has an open circuit between the IDM high side driver and the low side
                        (signal return) to the IDM. The SID No.s 1 - 8 indicate cylinder No.s in a similar manner.
