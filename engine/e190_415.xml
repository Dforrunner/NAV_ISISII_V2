        <para>Transmission tailshaft speed is detected by a magnetic pickup mounted on the transmission that senses the
            rotation of a 16 toothed gear installed on the rear of the transmission. The resultant AC (alternating
            current) sine wave signal is received by the ECM and is utilized along with tire size and axle ratio, to
            calculate vehicle speed. Calculated vehicle speed is transmitted to the instrument cluster on the ATA
            (American Trucking Association) data link to operate the speedometer in the instrument cluster. Calculated
            vehicle speed is also utilized in the control strategies that control features such as Cruise Control, PTO
            operation and Road Speed Limiting.
        </para>
        <para>W TEC MD transmissions utilize an internal VSS sensor that sends a signal to the W TEC ECM. The W TEC ECM
            buffers the signal and sends a square wave signal to the Engine ECM.
