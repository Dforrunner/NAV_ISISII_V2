            <caution>
                <para>To prevent engine damage, do not substitute fasteners. Original equipment standard hardware is
                    defined as Class 10.9 metric or Grade 8 standard coarse thread bolts and nuts and hardened flat
                    washers (Rockwell "C" 38-45), all phosphate coated.

        <para>The standard torque charts provide the tightening torque for general purpose applications using original
            equipment standard hardware as listed in the Parts Catalog for the application involved.

            <note>
                <para>Visually inspect parts for cleanliness and obvious defects prior to assembly.</para>
            </note>
        </specpara>
        <para>Many conditions affect torque and the results of torque applications. The major purpose in tightening a
            fastener to a specified torque is to obtain tension in the fastener (bolt and nut), which in turn develops a
            clamping load which exceeds any possible loading imposed on parts.
        </para>
        <para>New phosphate coated fasteners do not require oil lubrication during assembly and torque application.
            Reused fasteners (even if originally phosphate coated) do require oil lubrication to threads and under head
            area for proper torque application.
        </para>
        <para>Threads that are dry, excessively rough, battered or filled with dirt require considerable effort just to
            rotate. Then when the clamping load is developed or the bolt tension is applied, the torque reading mounts
            rapidly (due to thread friction) to the specified torque value. However, the desired bolt tension and
            correct clamping load is not achieved. This condition can lead to failure of the fastener to maintain
            component integrity. The proper bolt tension and clamping load can never be attained if the fastener is dry.
            The fastener threads must be new condition or have a film of clean lubricant (engine oil) to be considered
            lubricated.
