            <para>During pre-injection all internal components have returned to their spring loaded positions. The
                poppet valve is blocking high-pressure oil from entering the injector. The plunger and intensifier are
                at the top of their bore and the plunger cavity is full of fuel. Fuel pressure in the plunger cavity is
                the same as fuel gallery pressure.

                        plunger and intensifier. As the pressure of the pressurized oil above the intensifier drops, so

                        pressure drops below the VOP. Spring tension on the nozzle valve now resets it, and injection
                        stops.
