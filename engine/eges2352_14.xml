        <title>Glow Plug Controller System</title>
        <para>The glow plug system warms engine cylinders to improve cold engine starting. It also aids in reducing
            smoke and exhaust emissions during engine warm up.
        </para>
        <para>The ECM is programmed to energize the glow plugs (through the glow plug relay) while monitoring Engine
            Coolant Temperature (ECT) and Barometric Absolute Pressure (BAP).
        </para>
        <para>The glow plugs are activated longer when the engine is colder and if the barometric pressure is low (high
            altitude). Battery voltage is monitored to extend glow plug life. If the battery voltage is high, power to
            the glow plugs is modulated by turning the glow plug relay ON/OFF at programmed intervals.
        </para>
        <para>The engine is ready to start when the WAIT light goes out. Glow plugs can remain 'ON' for up to 120
            seconds while the engine is running to reduce exhaust emissions and white smoke during engine warm up.
