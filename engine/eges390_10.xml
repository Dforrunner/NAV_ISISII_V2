        <title>Air, Exhaust, and Crankcase Gas Flow</title>
        <para>Ambient air is initially drawn through the air filter assembly past the IAT sensor and into the air inlet
            duct.
        </para>
        <para>A crankcase breather and hose are used to draw crankcase gasses from the engine.</para>
        <para>Air continues to flow through the low-pressure turbocharger compressor (larger turbo), where it is
            compressed and discharged to the high-pressure turbocharger compressor (smaller turbo). The high-pressure
            compressor compresses discharge air to a higher pressure and temperature before it enters the CAC.
        </para>
        <para>As the compressed air (hot) flows through the CAC, ambient air flows across the CAC and heat is exchanged
            to the atmosphere. This heat exchange allows cooled (denser) air to enter the engine with enough pressure to
            give the correct air to fuel ratio.
        </para>
        <para>During cold weather startups, an inlet air heater warms the incoming air. The Electronic Control Module
            (ECM) controls the inlet air heater relay. The inlet air heater relay controls the operation of the inlet
            air heating element depending on ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure.
        </para>
        <para>Air flow continues in the intake manifold, past the intake valves and into the cylinders. After
            combustion, hot exhaust gases are forced through the exhaust manifolds and into the exhaust piping.
        </para>
        <para>Most of the hot exhaust gas flows into the turbocharger high-pressure turbine (smaller turbo), spinning
            the high-pressure turbine wheel. Exhaust continues to flow onto the low pressure turbine (larger turbo),
            spinning the low-pressure turbine wheel before exiting the turbocharger to the exhaust system.
        </para>
        <para>A portion of the hot exhaust gas is routed through the EGR cooler and EGR valve where it is metered into
            the intake manifold to blend with filtered incoming air. This helps reduce combustion temperatures and
            Oxides of Nitrogen (NO
            <subscript>X</subscript>).
        </para>
        <para>Exhaust flows through the exhaust piping, aftertreatment, and out the exhaust pipe.</para>
