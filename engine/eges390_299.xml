            <caution>
                <para>To prevent engine damage when removing the rear cover, cut the sealant where the crankcase and
                    lower crankcase meet. Cut sealant where the crankcase, high-pressure oil pump cover and rear cover
                    meet. Failure to adequately cut sealant before removing the rear cover can result in upper and lower
                    crankcase gaskets being pulled out. Engine removal and disassembly is required to replace the lower
                    crankcase gasket.
