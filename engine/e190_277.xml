        <title>FUNCTION</title>
        <para>The Navistar engine control system includes an Injection Control Pressure Sensor. The ECM measures the
            signal from the ICP sensor to determine the Injection Control Pressure as the engine is running to modulate
            the Injection Control Pressure Regulator. This is a closed loop function which means the ECM continuously
            monitors and adjusts for ideal Injection Control Pressure determined by operating conditions such as load,
            speed, and temperature.
        </para>
        <para>The ECM monitors the ICP signal to determine if the performance of the hydraulic system is satisfactory.
            During engine operation, if the ECM recognizes that the pressure reading is lower or higher than the value
            that was commanded, the ECM will set a fault code. This strategy is also used during the On Demand tests,
            commanded by the Electronic Service Tool and referred to as the Engine Running tests.
