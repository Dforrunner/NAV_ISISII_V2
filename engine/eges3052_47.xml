        <para id="s3050103">Continuous Monitor is a series of continuous diagnostic tests done by the Electronic Control
            Module (ECM) to detect failure modes (Out-of-Range, In-Range, and System Faults). During Continuous Monitor
            the ignition switch is on.

        <para>If an input signal is out-of-range (over or under normal operating range), the ECM logs a fault and sets a
            Diagnostic Trouble Code (DTC). The ECM monitors the operation of systems for in range conditions to
            determine if systems are working in a normal operational range. If the ECM detects that a system falls
            outside a predetermined range, it will log a fault and set a DTC.
        </para>
        <para>Each DTC has a three digit number to identify the source of a malfunction measured or monitored
            electronically. A fault is a malfunction measured or monitored electronically.
        </para>
        <para>The ECM continuously monitors the Injection Control Pressure (ICP) system and the Air Management System
            (AMS). If the ECM detects that a system falls outside a predetermined range, the ECM logs a fault and sets a
            DTC.
        </para>
        <para>During normal engine operation, the ECM automatically performs several tests to detect faults. When a
            fault is detected, the ECM often runs a fault management strategy to allow continued, though sometimes
            degraded, vehicle operation.
        </para>
        <para>With the engine running, engine events are permanently recorded in the ECM. Engine events can be retrieved
            with the Electronic Service Tool (EST).
