        <title>GENERAL FEATURES</title>
        <para>The International(r)7.3 Liter Diesel Engine is a four cycle naturally aspirated V-8 with overhead valves.
            It has a displacement of 7.3 liter (444 cu.in.).
        </para>
        <para>When viewing the engine from the rear, the right bank of cylinders are numbered 1, 3, 5 and 7 with number
            1 being at the front. The firing order is 1-2-7-3-4-5-6-8.
        </para>
        <para>The crankcase has been especially designed to withstand the loads of diesel operation and utilizes a four
            bolt main bearing to assure a rigid support for the rotating parts. The crankcase also has piston oil
            cooling jets which direct oil to the underside of the piston to dissipate heat. The crankshaft is a five
            main bearing unit with fore and aft thrust controlled at the center (No. 3) bearing. Connecting rods are of
            heavy-duty construction and are attached to the crankshaft, two to each crankpin journal with the piston pin
            being of free floating type permitting the pin to move or float freely in piston and rod. The pin is held in
            place with pin retaining rings.
        </para>
        <para>The camshaft is supported by five insert-type bearings pressed into the block and is driven by a drive
            gear keyed to the crankshaft. The end thrust of the camshaft is controlled by a thrust flange located
            between the front camshaft journal and the thrust flange spacer.
        </para>
        <para>The aluminum-alloy pistons are fitted with two compression rings and one oil ring and are used in the
            engine with forged steel connecting rods.
        </para>
        <para>The hydraulic valve lifters minimize engine noise and maintain zero valve lash or tappet clearance. This
            eliminates the need for periodic adjustment. The hydraulic valve lifters have roller followers which provide
            excellent camshaft durability characteristics.
        </para>
        <para>The cylinder head assemblies have pre-combustion chambers, which provide superior combustion
            characteristics. The cylinder heads used on the engine are equipped with a positive valve rotating mechanism
            on both the intake and exhaust valves. This device is called a rotator and is located at the base of each
            valve spring.
        </para>
        <para>A solid state glow plug system and block heater provide outstanding cold weather start capability.</para>
