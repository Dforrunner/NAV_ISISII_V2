            <para>Coolant temperature compensation reduces fuel delivery when the engine coolant temperature is above
                cooling system specifications.
            </para>
            <para>The reduction in fuel delivery begins when engine coolant temperature reaches approximately 107 &#176;C
                (225 &#176;F). A reduction of 15% will be achieved as the temperature reaches approximately 110 &#176;C
                (230 &#176;F).
            </para>
            <para>When the engine coolant temperature is above110 &#176;C (230 &#176;F), the red ENGINE lamp is
                illuminated and an audible alarm sounds. After the alarm sounds, the engine will shutdown.

                        flash, an audible alarm will sound, and DTC 322 will be set. If the vehicle has the warning
                        protection feature enabled, the engine will shutdown after 30 seconds.

            <para>Fuel reduction is calibrated to a maximum of 30% before standard engine warning or optional EWPS is
                engaged. A DTC is stored in the ECM memory when a warning or shutdown occurs.
