            <para>Voltage is an electrical pressure or force that pushes the current through a circuit. The pressure is
                measured in Volts and the symbol V (as in 12V) is used in the circuit diagrams. The letter "E" is also
                used for voltage and stands for Electromotive Force. Voltage can be compared to the pressure necessary
                to push water through a metering valve.

            <para>Low voltage to a lamp will cause the lamp to glow dimly. This can be caused by low source voltage
                (battery discharged or low alternator output), or by high circuit resistance in the circuit due to a
                poor connection. The resistance of the poor connection or poor ground acts as an additional load in the
                circuit, causing less voltage to be available to push current through the load device. Before making any
                meter measurements, it is important to briefly review the relationship between voltage, current, and
                resistance (Ohms Law).
