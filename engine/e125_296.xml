            <title>FUNCTION</title>
            <para>The Navistar engine control system includes an Exhaust Back Pressure Regulator (EPR) Valve. The valve
                controls exhaust back pressure in cold ambient temperatures to increase cab heat and decrease the amount
                of time required to defrost the windshield. The EPR valve consists of a solenoid, poppet and spool valve
                assembly and is mounted on the turbocharger pedestal. The ECM regulates exhaust back pressure by
                controlling the duty cycle of ON/OFF time of the exhaust pressure regulator solenoid. The increase or
                decrease of ON/OFF time positions a spool valve internal to the EPR which in turn either increases or
                decreases the amount of exhaust back pressure.

            <title>OPERATION</title>
            <para>The EPR valve is supplied with voltage at Terminal B of the EPR connector from Terminal 11 of the ECM.
                Control of the exhaust pressure regulator is accomplished by the ECM varying the pulse width or
                percentage of ON/OFF time of the EPR solenoid. Normal ON/OFF time varies from 0% to 95%. A high duty
                cycle indicates that the exhaust back pressure valve is being closed to raise the amount of exhaust back
                pressure based on (ambient) intake air temperature, engine oil temperature, engine load and exhaust back
                pressure.
