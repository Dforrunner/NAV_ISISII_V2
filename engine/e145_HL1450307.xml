        <title>HARNESS RESISTANCE TESTS</title>
        <para>Harness resistance tests are performed when a circuit is suspected of having high resistance or being
            open. These tests are performed with the breakout box connected and by measuring resistance from the sensor
            connector end to the processor connector. If an open circuit or high resistance is encountered, the problem
            is most easily isolated by separating the circuit at the interim connectors (normally the Deutsch connector
            on the valve cover or the cowl) and measuring resistance through both halves of the circuit.
