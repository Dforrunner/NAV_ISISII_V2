            <para>The cooling system keeps the engine within a designated temperature range. The major components of the
                cooling system include the following:

            <para>A belt-driven, centrifugal water pump set into the front cover has three passages. One passage
                channels coolant from the water pump to the crankcase, the second returns coolant to the water pump, and
                the third (a bypass) channels coolant back to the water pump when the thermostat is closed.
            </para>
            <para>Incoming coolant flows from the bottom of the radiator through a water inlet elbow to the front cover
                and water pump. Coolant is pumped to the crankcase through a passage in the front cover and crankcase.
            </para>
            <para>Water jackets in the crankcase direct coolant from front to rear, distributing coolant evenly to the
                lower sections of the cylinder sleeves. Coolant flow is directed tangent to each cylinder sleeve,
                causing a swirling motion up to the cylinder head. The swirling action improves heat absorption.
            </para>
            <para>Coolant flows from the cylinder sleeve areas in three ways:</para>

                    <para>Coolant flows into the oil system module assembly through the right side of the crankcase,
                        passes through the oil system module, and returns through a tube to the front cover.

                    <para>Coolant exits the crankcase at the upper end of each cylinder sleeve bore, distributed evenly
                        through metering holes in the cylinder head. Coolant then flows through the cylinder head (back
                        to front) to the thermostat.

            <para>The EGR cooler receives coolant from the front cover. Coolant flows from the front of the cooler and
                exits the rear of the cooler into the rear of the cylinder head. A deaeration port is on top of the EGR
                cooler.

                <title>Thermostat Operation</title>
            </para>
            <para>The thermostat has two outlets. One directs coolant to the radiator when the engine is at operating
                temperature. The other directs coolant to the water pump until the engine reaches operating temperature.
                The thermostat begins to open at 88 &#176;C (190 &#176;F) and is fully open at 96 &#176;C (205 &#176;F).

            <para>When engine coolant is below the 88 &#176;C (190 &#176;F) the thermostat is closed, blocking flow to
                the radiator. Coolant is forced to flow through a bypass port back to the water pump.

            <para>When coolant temperature reaches the nominal opening temperature - 88 &#176;C (190 &#176;F) - the
                thermostat opens allowing some coolant to flow to the radiator. When coolant temperature exceeds 96
                &#176;C (205 &#176;F), the lower seat blocks the bypass port directing full coolant flow to the
                radiator.
