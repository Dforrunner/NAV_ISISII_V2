        <para>The lubrication system is pressure regulated, cooled, and full flow filtered.</para>
        <para>Oil is drawn from the oil pan through the pickup tube, upper oil pan, lower crankcase, and the front cover
            to the gerotor oil pump.
        </para>
        <para>The gerotor oil pump includes the front cover assembly, gerotor assembly (inner and outer gears), and the
            gerotor housing cover. The crankshaft drives the inner rotor gear of the gerotor pump.
        </para>
        <para>The gerotor pump pressurizes lube oil. Pressurized lube oil flows from the front cover through a passage
            in the lower crankcase. Lube oil from the lower crankcase flows through a passage in the upper crankcase to
            the oil cooler base. Passages in the oil cooler base direct lube oil and coolant.
