            <title>Function</title>
            <para>The Navistar engine control system includes a Glow Plug Control System that controls the current flow
                to the glow plugs. Glow plug relay "ON" time is controlled by the ECM and is a function of Engine
                Coolant Temperature, Barometric Pressure, and Battery Voltage. Glow plug "ON" time varies between 10-120
                seconds. Glow plugs are self limiting glow plugs and do not require to be cycled on and off. The glow
                plug relay will cycle on and off repeatedly, if battery voltage is greater than 13.0 volts.

                ) for the following discussion.
            </para>
            <para>Glow Plug System operation "ON" time is dependent upon engine coolant temperature, barometric pressure
                and battery voltage. The ECM turns on the glow plug relay by supplying power through the engine
                connector pin #38 to circuit 97CH. The coil of the glow plug relay is grounded through circuit 97GR
                through engine connector pin #28. Power is supplied to the switch side of the glow plug relay from the
                starter motor. When the relay coil is energized, power is supplied to the glow plugs which are grounded
                through the cylinder head.
            </para>
            <para>The "Wait To Start Lamp" is controlled through chassis connector pin #53. The lamp is illuminated when
                the ECM grounds circuit 18G through pin #53.
            </para>
            <para>The Glow Plug Wait Lamp is also turned on by the ECM when the glow plug relay is enabled.</para>

                <note>
                    <para>Wait light on time is independent from glow plug relay on time and is usually much shorter in
                        duration.

            <title>ECM DIAGNOSTICS</title>
            <para>The ECM does not continuously monitor the glow plug control circuitry. An open or shorted to ground
                glow plug control relay on the control side (coil) circuit can be detected by an on demand output
                circuit check performed during the engine off test.
            </para>
            <para>Fault codes can be retrieved using the electronic service tool or the STI Self Test Input Diagnostic
                Switch located on the vehicle dashboard. If the ignition key is shutoff, the code will be stored as an
                active code.

                determined it is above or below specification. If the fault is present, the glow plug relay is not
                operating and the glow plugs are not enabled.
