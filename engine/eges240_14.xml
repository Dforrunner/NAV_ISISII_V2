            <title>High pressure oil flow</title>
        </para>
        <para>Oil is drawn from the oil reservoir, filled by the engine lubrication system. The reservoir provides a
            constant supply of oil to a high pressure hydraulic pump inside the crankcase. The high pressure pump is a
            gear-driven swash-plate pump. The high pressure pump delivers high pressure oil through a discharge tube on
            the pump.
        </para>
        <para>High pressure oil flows through the rear branch high pressure tube to each crankcase high pressure tube.
            Oil flows through a flexible hose attached to each high pressure tube to a check valve on the high pressure
            rail. The high pressure oil rail supplies high pressure oil to the top of each fuel injector.
        </para>
        <para>Fuel injectors use high pressure oil when the OPEN coil is energized to pressurize and atomize the fuel
            into the combustion chamber. When injection is complete the CLOSED coil is energized to end injection. Oil
            leaves the hydraulic section of the injector near the top.

            <caption>ICP closed loop system</caption>
        </figure>
        <para>The ICP is a closed loop system that uses the ICP sensor to provide feedback to the ECM. The ECM uses the
            ICP sensor to continuously monitor ICP and adjust the duty cycle to the IPR to match engine requirements.

        <para>
            <title>ICP operation</title>
        </para>
        <para>The solenoid receives a pulse width modulated signal from the ECM that indicates the on/off time the
            control valve is energized. The pulse is modulated to control ICP pressure in the range of 3 to 20 MPa (500
            to 3,000 psi).
        </para>
        <para>The IPR valve is mounted in the high pressure pump cover. The IPR valve maintains the desired ICP by
            dumping excess oil out the bottom of the high pressure pump cover.
        </para>
        <para>High pressure oil is routed to the IPR valve and ICP sensor through the discharge tube and passages in the
            high pressure pump cover.
        </para>
        <para>As the demand for ICP increases, the ECM increases the pulse width to the IPR solenoid. When ICP demand
            decreases, the ECM decreases the (duty cycle) to the solenoid, allowing oil to flow from the drain orifice.
        </para>
        <para>The ECM sets Diagnostic Trouble codes (DTCs), if the ICP electrical signal is out of range. DTCs are also
            set if an ICP signal corresponds to an out of range value for injection control pressure for a given
            operating condition.
        </para>
        <para>The ECM will ignore ICP signals that are out of range. The IPR valve will operate from preprogrammed
            default values. This is called Open Loop.
