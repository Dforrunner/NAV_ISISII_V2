            <para>Engine Data Line (EDL) output from the ECM controls the Transmission Modulator Shift Solenoid Control
                Relay (403), which in turn controls the Transmission Modulator Shift Solenoid (404).
            </para>
            <para>The ECM is programmed with two shift schedules: Closed Throttle Mode and Wide Open Throttle Mode. The
                Closed Throttle Mode schedule for a transmission is for situations with a moderate engine load. The
                transmission will shift at approximately 65 percent of engine load. The Wide Open Throttle Mode shift
                schedule has shift points that occur at 80 percent of engine load. This provides increased power in
                heavy load situations for passing or faster acceleration.
            </para>
            <para>The ECM analyzes engine operating data and determines which mode is most appropriate for current
                operation. The physical Allison transmission uses EDL output from ECM connector (379) terminal 32 to
                select the most appropriate shift schedule depending upon engine loads.
            </para>
            <para>Refer to the circuit diagram (

                ) for the following discussion.
            </para>
            <para>When ECM terminal 32 is LOW (0 volts), the transmission operates in the Closed Throttle Mode (normal
                shift schedule). When ECM terminal 32 is HIGH (12 volts), the transmission operates in the Wide Open
                Throttle Mode.

            <title>WIDE OPEN THROTTLE - MODE OPERATION</title>
            <para>In the Wide Open Throttle Mode, ECM terminal 32 is HIGH (12 volts) and the XMSN Shift Modulator (404)
                is energized. The Transmission Modulator Shift Solenoid Control Relay (403) receives ignition power at
                common terminal 30 and control coil terminal 86. When ECM terminal 32 is HIGH (12 volts), circuits 97F
                and 92E have 12V so the relay (403) does not energize. The ignition power on circuit 92B goes through
                the normally closed (N.C.) contacts (30 to 87A) to the Transmission Modulator Shift Solenoid (404),
                causing the shift solenoid to energize.

            <title>CLOSED THROTTLE MODE OPERATION</title>
            <para>In the Closed Throttle Mode, ECM terminal 32 is LOW (0 volts) and Transmission Shift Modulator (404)
                is not energized. When ECM terminal 32 is LOW (0 volts), circuit 97F grounds the Modulator Shift Control
                Relay control coil causing the relay to energize, opening the normally closed (N.C.) contacts (30 to
                87A) in relay (403), TURNING OFF the power to the Transmission Modulator Shift Solenoid (404), which is
                de-energized.
