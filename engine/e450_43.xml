                glass, bent gauge needles, and for missing pressure connectors and nylon tubing. Replace damaged or
                missing parts so that the kit will operate when needed.

                carrying case. If any liquids are found in the tubing behind the panel, loosen the connections and blow
                out the liquids. Tighten all connectors as required and reassemble the gauge panel.

                a gauge accuracy test is desired, proceed as described under "CALIBRATING THE PRESSURE KIT using the
