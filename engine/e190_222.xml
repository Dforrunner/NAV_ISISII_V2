        <title>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION</title>
        <para>Engine Data Line (EDL) output from the ECM controls the Transmission Modulator Shift Solenoid Control
            Relay, which in turn controls the Transmission Modulator Shift Solenoid.
        </para>
        <para>The ECM is programmed with two shift schedules: Closed Throttle Mode and Wide Open Throttle Mode. The
            Closed Throttle Mode schedule for a transmission is for situations with a moderate engine load. The
            transmission will shift at approximately 65 percent of engine load. The Wide Open Throttle Mode shift
            schedule has shift points that occur at 80 percent of engine load. This provides increased power in heavy
            load situations for passing or faster acceleration.
        </para>
        <para>Refer to circuit diagram (

            ) for the following description.
        </para>
        <para>The ECM analyzes engine operating data and determines which mode is most appropriate for current
            operation. The physical Allison transmission uses EDL output from ECM connector pin 56 to select the most
            appropriate shift schedule depending upon engine loads.
        </para>
        <para>When ECM pin 56 is LOW (0 volts), the transmission operates in the Closed Throttle Mode (normal shift
            schedule). When ECM pin 56 is HIGH (12 volts), the transmission operates in the Wide Open Throttle Mode.
