        <svcprocinfo>
            <para>The ECM does not continuously monitor the glow plug control circuitry. An open or shorted to ground
                glow plug control relay on the control side (coil) circuit can be detected by an on demand output
                circuit check performed during the engine off test.
            </para>
            <para>Fault codes can be retrieved using the electronic service tool or the STI Self Test Input Diagnostic
                Switch located on the vehicle dashboard. If the ignition key is shutoff, the code will be stored as an
                active code.

            <title>FLASH CODE 251 - ATA CODE SID 38 FMI 11 - GPC: OCC SELF TEST FAILED</title>
            <para>Code 251 is set only during the Engine Off Standard Output Circuit check. This indicates that the ECM
                has performed an output circuit test, measured the voltage drop across the glow plug relay circuit and
                determined it is above or below specification. If the fault is present, the glow plug relay is not
                operating and the glow plugs are not enabled.
            </para>
            <para>Possible Causes: Open feed circuit, open glow plug relay coil, an open or shorted GPC signal
                circuit.

            <para>Code 252 is set only during the Engine Off Standard Output Circuit check. This indicates that the ECM
                has performed an output circuit test, measured the voltage drop across the glow plug Wait Lamp circuit
                and determined it is above or below specification.
