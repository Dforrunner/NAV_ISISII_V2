            <para>"Engine Off Tests" are "Standard Tests" performed by the ECM. These tests are commanded by the
                technician using the Electronic Service Tool (EST) or using the Self Test Input (STI) push-button
                switch.
            </para>
            <para>To perform the test using the EST, access the Engine menu and select Diagnostic Tests. Then select
                Engine Off Tests. Depressing the Enter key will initiate the test.
            </para>
            <para>To use the STI diagnostic push-button switch, depress the switch and hold in, while turning the
                ignition switch to the "ON" position. Release the STI button after the key is in the "ON" position.
                <emph type="bold">Do not start the engine.</emph>
            </para>
            <para>When the operator signals the test to begin, the ECM will perform internal tests of its processing
                components and internal memory.
            </para>
            <para>It will automatically proceed to Output Circuit Check (OCC). This test checks output circuits to
                detect shorts or opens in the ECM, the harnesses or the actuators; by operating the ECM output circuits
                and measuring each individual circuit's responses. If a circuit fails the test, a fault code will be
                logged in the memory.
            </para>
            <para>The following circuits are checked by the ECM during the test:</para>

            <para>The Output circuits check test only evaluate the electrical condition of the circuits involved and can
                only be performed by commanding the KOEO test. It does not evaluate the mechanical or hydraulic

            <para>When the test is complete, the EST will display any faults that were found during the test. If the STI
                diagnostic switch was used to perform the test, the faults will be transmitted as "Flash Codes," using
                the Oil Warning and Engine Warning lights.
            </para>
            <para>The fault codes are read by counting the number of light flashes. The following sequence occurs:
