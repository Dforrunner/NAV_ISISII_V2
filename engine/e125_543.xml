        <title>OUTPUT STATE TEST</title>
        <para>The next test available is the
            <emph type="bold">"OUTPUT STATE TEST"</emph>. This will signal the ECM to energize the output circuits for
            testing.
        </para>
        <para>There are two modes of operation during this test. The first is
            <emph type="bold">"OUTPUT ARE LOW"</emph>
            and the other is
            <emph type="bold">"OUTPUTS ARE HIGH"</emph>.
        </para>
        <para>When in the
            <emph type="bold">"OUTPUTS ARE LOW"</emph>
            mode the ECM will pull down the output voltage to ground. This will actuate the output components that are
            controlled by the ECM grounding the circuits. During this test
            <emph type="bold">"OUTPUTS ARE LOW"</emph>
            will be displayed on the screen.
        </para>
        <para>When in the
            <emph type="bold">"OUTPUTS ARE HIGH"</emph>
            mode the ECM will pull up the output voltage to 12 volts. This will actuate the output components that are
            controlled by the ECM energizing the control circuits with 12 volts. During this test,
            <emph type="bold">"OUTPUTS ARE HIGH"</emph>will be displayed on the screen.
        </para>
        <para>During this test, the following components will be exercised, IDM Enable relay, EPR (Exhaust Back Pressure
            Regulator), IPR (Injection Pressure Regulator), ECI (Engine Crank Inhibit Relay), EDL (Engine Data Link
            Relay), OWL (Oil/Water Light &#38; Alarm), VRE (Vehicle Retarder enable) relay and WARN engine light.
        </para>
        <para>To access this test press the "&#8595;" key until
            <emph type="bold">"OUTPUT STATE TEST"</emph>
            appears on the screen. Press
            <emph type="bold">"ENTER"</emph>
            to start the test.
        </para>
        <para>Press the
            <emph type="bold">"ENTER"</emph>
            key to switch from
            <emph type="bold">"OUTPUTS ARE LOW"</emph>
            to
            <emph type="bold">"OUTPUTS ARE HIGH"</emph>. The mode will change each time the
            <emph type="bold">"ENTER"</emph>
            key is pressed.
        </para>
        <para>To end the test press the
            <emph type="bold">"FUNC"</emph>
            key.
        </para>
        <para>While the test is being performed the technician can measure output circuits to be certain the ECM outputs
            are functioning properly.
