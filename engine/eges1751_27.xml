        <title>Continuous Monitoring</title>
        <para>The Electronic Control Module (ECM) continuously monitors and detects Out of Range, Rationality, and
            System Faults.

            <emph type="bold">Diagnostic Trouble Codes</emph>
        </para>
        <para>Each Diagnostic Trouble Code has three numbers that identify the source of a malfunction measured or
            monitored electronically. Most Diagnostic Trouble Codes indicate the source and the Failure Mode. The
            Failure Mode identifies one of the following signal readings:

        <para>When the ignition key is ON, the ECM will record and set a Diagnostic Trouble Code if an input signal is
            Out of Range High or Out of Range Low during normal operation. The ECM also monitors the operation of
            systems and determines if systems are In Range. If a system falls outside a predetermined range, the ECM
            will record and set a Diagnostic Trouble Code.
        </para>
        <para>During normal engine operation, the ECM automatically performs several tests to detect Diagnostic Trouble
            Codes. When Diagnostic Trouble Codes are detected, the ECM often executes a DTC management strategy to allow
            continued, though sometimes degraded, vehicle operation.
        </para>
        <para>The ECM sets Diagnostic Trouble Codes associated with the injection control system, on a continuous basis
            when detected. This is an improvement from previous versions that required specific diagnostic tests to
            access fault codes.
        </para>
        <para>
            <title>Engine Events</title>
        </para>
        <para>With the engine running, Engine Events are permanently recorded in the ECM; Engine Events can be retrieved
            with the Electronic Service Tool (EST). Standard Engine Events include excessive coolant temperature and
            engine rpm (overspeed).
        </para>
        <para>
            <title>Engine Event Hours</title>
        </para>
        <para>With the engine running, Event Engine Hours are monitored and recorded in the ECM. Event Engine Hours
            include data resulting from overheating (coolant temperature), low coolant level, low oil pressure, and
            operation beyond maximum rpm. This information and odometer / hourmeter readings are stored in the ECM
            memory.
