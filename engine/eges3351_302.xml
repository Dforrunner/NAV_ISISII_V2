        <title>Service Procedure</title>
        <para>Valve bridges, guides, springs, retainer keys, and valve stem seals are common between the intake and
            exhaust sides of the cylinder head. Rotators are always used on intake valves and can be used on exhaust
            valves. Some low horsepower engines have retainers on the exhaust valves.
        </para>
        <para>New valve bridges can be installed on the intake or exhaust valves in either direction, and are also part
            of compression brake operation.
        </para>
        <para>Valve guides and valve seats are replaceable.</para>
        <para>Valve rotators allow valves to rotate for increased valve face life.</para>
        <para>Valve stem seals are one piece and have a hardened washer for valve spring seating.</para>
        <para>Phosphate coating is used on rocker arms for initial break-in and to extend life.</para>
        <para>Pressurized oil is fed from the crankcase through the cylinder head at the cylinder 6 exhaust lower
            support. Oil then enters the rocker shaft and is distributed to the rocker arms.
