            <title>Injection Control Pressure System Operation</title>
            <para>The Injection Control Pressure system provides the necessary energy to hydraulically actuate the HEUI
                injectors. Engine lube oil is the hydraulic fluid used for this purpose.
            </para>
            <para>Lube oil is drawn from the oil pan through the pickup tube by the engine oil lubrication pump. The
                lubrication pump is a gerotor type pump driven by the crankshaft. Filtered oil is fed through passages
                in the front cover to the oil reservoir which is an integral part of the front cover.
            </para>
            <para>The reservoir provides a constant supply of oil to a high pressure hydraulic pump mounted to the front
                cover. The high pressure pump is a gear driven swash plate type pump. High pressure oil is delivered by
                the high pressure pump to the high pressure oil supply manifold and into oil passages machined into the
                cylinder head.
            </para>
            <para>When the injector solenoid is energized, high pressure lube oil is utilized to pressurize and atomize
                fuel into the combustion chamber. After injection is complete the solenoid is deactivated and the oil
                within the injector is vented through the top portion of the injector and allowed to drain back to the
                oil pan.
            </para>
            <para>Injection control pressure is governed by the Electronic Control Module (ECM) depending on operating
                conditions and the driver's demand for power. The Injection Pressure Regulator (IPR) is utilized by the
                ECM for this purpose.
            </para>
            <para>The IPR is a pressure regulator valve which is electrically controlled by the ECM to control the
                pressure of the oil in the injection control pressure system. The IPR valve is mounted on the high
                pressure pump and achieves injection control pressure regulation by dumping excess oil into the front
                cover and back to the oil pan.
            </para>
            <para>The injection control pressure sensor provides pressure information in the form of an analog voltage
                signal to the ECM. Injection control pressure ranges from 500 to 3000 psi (3.4 to 20 MPa), depending on
                the engine family.
