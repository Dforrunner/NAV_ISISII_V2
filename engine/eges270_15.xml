        </para>
        <para>Two 48 volt 20 amp coils control a spool valve that directs oil flow in and out of the injector. The
            injector coils are turned on for approximately 800 &#181;s (microseconds or millionths of a second). Each
            injector has a single four pin connector that couples to the valve cover gasket assembly.

            <title>Injector Coils and Spool Valve</title>
        </para>
        <para>An OPEN coil and a CLOSE coil on the injector move the spool valve from side to side using magnetic force.
            The spool has two positions:

            <title>Intensifier Piston and Plunger</title>
        </para>
        <para>When the spool valve is open, high-pressure oil enters the injector pushing down the intensifier piston
            and plunger. Since the intensifier piston is 7.1 times greater in surface area than the plunger, the
            injection pressure is also 7.1 times greater than ICP pressure on the plunger.

        <para>
            <title>Plunger and Barrel</title>
        </para>
        <para>Fuel pressure builds at the base of the plunger in the barrel. When the intensifier piston pushes the
            plunger down, the plunger increases fuel pressure in the barrel 7.1 times greater than ICP. The plunger has
            a diamond-like coating to resist scuffing.

        <para>The injector needle opens inward, off its seat when fuel pressure overcomes the Valve Opening Pressure
            (VOP) of 28 mPa (4,075 psi). Fuel is atomized at high pressure through the nozzle tip.

        <para>A pulse-width controlled current energizes the OPEN coil. Magnetic force moves the spool valve open.
            High-pressure oil flows past the spool valve and onto the top of the intensifier piston. Oil pressure
            overcomes the force of the intensifier piston spring and the intensifier starts to move down. An increase in
            fuel pressure under the plunger seats the fuel inlet check ball, and fuel pressure starts to build on the
            needle.

        <para>The pulse-width controlled current to the OPEN coil is shut off, but the spool valve remains open. High
            pressure oil from high pressure oil rail continues to flow past the spool valve. The intensifier piston and

            about 28 MPa (4,075 psi) - the needle lifts of its seat and injection begins.

        <para>When the Injector Drive Module (IDM) determines that the correct injector on-time has been reached (the
