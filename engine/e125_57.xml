                to begin test. The ECM will begin to raise the engine idle speed to a predetermined value. It will then
                command the IPR valve to set the injection control pressure to rated speed pressure. If the performance
                of the IPR is acceptable,the ECM will control the IPR valve to reduce the pressure in steps while
                continuing to monitor the performance of the injection control pressure system.
            </para>
            <para>At the completion of the IPR test, the ECM will conduct a similar test on the EPR valve. When testing
                is completed, normal engine operation is restored and fault codes will be transmitted as described
                previously.

            <para>The Injector Test is designed to detect problems with injection and combustion events. During the test
                the ECM will control fuel delivery and determine each cylinder's power contribution. If a cylinder is
                not performing satisfactorily, a fault code will be set.
