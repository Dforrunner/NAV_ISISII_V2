        <para>The unique design of the lubricating oil pressure relief valve, [80 psi (552 kPa)] located in the front
            cover (

            ) and the oil pressure regulating valve [50 psi (345 kPa)], located by the rear oil cooler header (
            <emph type="bold">Figure
                <hotlnk document="e105_15.xml" xrefid="f105IN13">13</hotlnk>

            ), extends the life of the engine because it controls the volume and pressure of oil supplied to the engine.
            The volume of oil supplied by the pump is always in excess of what is needed to lubricate the engine. The
            oil pressure relief valve is located in the front cover and is used to protect the oil cooler and oil filter
            from extremely high pressures encountered during cold starts and cold starts in cold weather. If oil
            pressure exceeds 80 psi (552 kPa) on the valve face, it moves the valve body inward allowing oil to travel
            through the valve and back to the oil pan, thus relieving pressure in the lubrication system.
        </para>
        <para>The oil pressure regulator valve is located on the right side of the block, between oil filter header and
            block. When all points of lubrication within the engine are satisfied, restriction to flow causes pressure
            to build on the case of the valve causing it to move inward. This action allows excess oil to go directly
            back to the oil pan, through the ports uncovered by the movement of the regulator valve body.
