        </para>
        <para>The oil reservoir in the front cover provides a constant supply of oil to a high-pressure oil pump mounted
            to the backside of the front cover. Oil drawn from the oil reservoir is constantly refilled by the engine
            lubrication system.
        </para>
        <para>The gear-driven, high-pressure oil pump delivers oil through a high-pressure oil hose, through a cylinder
            head passage into the high-pressure oil manifold beneath the valve cover. The manifold distributes to the
            top of each fuel injector.
        </para>
        <para>When the OPEN coil for each injector is energized, the injectors use high-pressure oil to inject and
            atomize fuel in the combustion chambers. To end injection, the CLOSE coils are energized. Exhaust oil exits
            through two ports in the top of the fuel injectors, then drains back to sump.

            <caption>ICP closed loop system</caption>
        </figure>
        <para>The ICP is a closed loop system that uses the ICP sensor to provide feedback to the ECM. The ECM uses the
            ICP sensor to continuously monitor injection control pressure and adjust the duty cycle of the IPR valve to
            match engine requirements.

            <title>ICP Operation</title>
        </para>
        <para>The IPR solenoid receives a pulse-width modulated signal from the ECM that indicates the on and off time
            the control valve is energized. The pulse is calibrated to control ICP pressure in a range from 5 MPa (725
            psi) up to 28 MPa (4,075 psi). Maximum pressure relief occurs at about 32 MPa (4,600 psi).
        </para>
        <para>The IPR valve is mounted in the body of the high-pressure pump. The IPR valve maintains the desired ICP by
            dumping excess oil back to the crankcase sump.
        </para>
        <para>As demand for ICP increases, the ECM increases the pulse-width modulation to the IPR solenoid. When ICP
            demand decreases, the ECM decreases the duty cycle to the solenoid, allowing more oil to flow from the drain
            orifice.
        </para>
        <para>The ECM sets Diagnostic Trouble Codes (DTCs), if the ICP electrical signal is out-of-range. DTCs are also
            set if an ICP signal corresponds to an out-of-range value for injection control pressure for a given
            operating condition.
        </para>
        <para>The ECM will ignore ICP signals that are out-of-range and the IPR valve will operate from programmed
            default values. This is called Open Loop operation.
        </para>
        <para>The ICP sensor is installed under the valve cover, forward of the No. 6 fuel injector in the high-pressure
            oil rail.
