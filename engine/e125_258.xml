                ) for the following discussion.
            </para>
            <para>The Electronic Control Module (ECM) Power Relay (395) has battery power supplied directly from the
                batteries to terminal 30. This circuit is protected by the 15A ECM #1 PWR fuse that is part of the
                battery cable assembly.
            </para>
            <para>When the key switch is turned ON, the ECM Power Relay (395) is energized by ignition power from 5A
                fuse F5 (5A fuse C1 with FBC) at the relay control coil terminal 86. With the ECM Power Relay (395)
                energized, power flows through the normally open (N.O.) relay contacts (30 to 87) then on circuit 97AR
                to ECM connector (379), terminals 37 and 57.
            </para>
            <para>The ground side of the ECM Power Relay control coil (terminal 85) is grounded by circuit 11-GK at the
                Electronic Ground Stud located at the cab. The Diode Assy (415) prevents the electronic components from
                voltage spikes created by the relay opening and closing.
            </para>
            <para>The ECM power ground terminals 40 and 60 are grounded through ECM connector (379) at the negative
                battery terminal.
