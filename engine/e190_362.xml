        <para>Enabling the remote preset signal allows for the engine to maintain a preprogrammed speed. When in the
            preset mode, a signal at the set terminal will cause the engine to run at the preprogrammed "set speed". A
            signal at the resume terminal will allow the engine to run at the preprogrammed "resume" speed.
        </para>
        <para>To operate, a 12 volt signal is sent to ECM pin 37. With the remote preset enabled, the speed is adjusted
            as with in cab preset. See in cab preset for more details.
        </para>
        <para>Opening the switch to pin 37 or depressing the brake pedal, clutch pedal or placing the automatic
            transmission in gear, as well as a signal from the VSS will deactivate the PTO speed control. However, the
            preprogrammed option of PTO Operation Disable will prevent the clutch and brake signals from interrupting
            the PTO speed control, as well as cause the APS to be inoperative. PTO speed control will not be functional
            if the Vss or Brake signal is in fault.
