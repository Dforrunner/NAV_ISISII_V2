        <para>A gear-driven, high-pressure oil pump draws oil through a screen in the oil reservoir for the
            high-pressure oil pump. The oil reservoir, in the top of the crankcase below the oil cooler, is kept full by
            the engine lubrication system.
        </para>
        <para>The IPR valve maintains the ICP pressure by dumping excess oil back to the crankcase.</para>
        <para>High-pressure oil from the pump flows through a branch tube assembly to each case-to-head tube assembly to
            each high-pressure oil rail.
        </para>
        <para>High pressure oil in the oil rails enter the fuel injectors through sealed ports in the top of the fuel
            injectors.
        </para>
        <para>When the OPEN coil for each injector is energized, the injector uses high-pressure oil to inject and
            atomize fuel into the combustion chamber. The CLOSE coils are energized to end injection. Exhaust oil exits
            through two ports in the top of the injector and drains back to the crankcase.
