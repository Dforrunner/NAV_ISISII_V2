            <para>The dual stage turbocharger responds directly to engine loads. Different engine loads affect exhaust
                energy that determines turbocharger speed. Turbocharger speed controls boost pressure for various engine
                loads. The dual stages of the turbocharger contribute to the lowering of exhaust emissions.
            </para>
            <para>At engine low idle, engine load and boost are low. As engine rpm increase, more fuel and air enter the
                cylinders. Exhaust temperature and pressure increase; higher exhaust energy increases turbine and
                compressor speed that raises the pressure and temperature of inlet boost air.
            </para>
            <para>As engine rpm and load decrease, less fuel and air enter the cylinders. Exhaust temperature and
                pressure decrease; lower exhaust energy decreases turbine and compressor speed that lowers the pressure
                and temperature of boost air.

            </figure>
            <para>During light loads, all exhaust flows through the high-pressure turbine and low-pressure turbine.
            </para>
            <para>The filtered air, mixed with crankcase vapors, is drawn to the low-pressure compressor. The air
                mixture is compressed and discharged to the high-pressure compressor. The high-pressure compressor
                compresses the discharge air at higher pressure, temperature, and density before it enters the Charge
                Air Cooler (CAC).
            </para>
            <para>When boost pressure reaches a predetermined value, a pneumatic actuator opens a valve, allowing some
                exhaust to bypass the high-pressure turbine and flow directly to the low-pressure turbine; maximum boost
                pressure is limited.
