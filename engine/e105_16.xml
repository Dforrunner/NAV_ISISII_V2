        <para>When the priming pump is pushed down, the check ball is seated onto the fuel strainer. Releasing the
            priming pump unseats the check ball, draws fuel from the fuel tank, through the inlet port of the fuel
            filter header and into the fuel strainer assembly. Fuel exists the strainer, flows through the internal
            passage of the fuel filter header, via a fuel line to the transfer pump located on the fuel injection pump.
        </para>
        <para>Once the engine has been primed, the fuel transfer pump keeps the fuel line under negative pressure with a
            constant supply of fuel.
