        <description>
            <geninfo>
                <para>The DT 466 and DT 570 cylinder heads are cast iron and feature four valves per cylinder.</para>
                <para>The design of the cylinder head valve train focuses on component commonality between the intake
                    and exhaust sides of the head. Shared parts include: valve bridges, guides, springs, retainer keys,
                    rotators, and valve stem seals. These parts are also compatible between the 466 and 570 engine
                    families.
                </para>
                <para>The valve rotators create positive valve rotation for increased valve face life.</para>
                <para>The valve stem seals are one piece design, easy to install, and have a hardened washer for valve
                    spring seating.
                </para>
                <para>The valve guides and valve seats are replaceable.</para>
                <para>The bridge can be installed on the intake or exhaust in either direction, and still allow
                    compression brake operation through the pad on top.
                </para>
                <para>A single roller tappet transfers lifting forces through a push rod, rocker arm, and then onto a
                    valve bridge where both valves are opened and closed simultaneously. This allows for a greater
                    quantity of air to flow through the engine than comparably sized engines using only two valves per
                    cylinder.
                </para>
                <para>Phosphate coating has been carried over from past production to rocker arms for initial break-in
                    and to extend life.
                </para>
                <para>Pressurized oil is fed from the crankcase through the head at cylinder number 6 exhaust lower
                    support. Oil then enters shaft and is distributed to all rocker arms.
