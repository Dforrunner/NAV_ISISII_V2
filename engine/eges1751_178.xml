        <title>OHMMETER</title>
        <svcprocinfo>
            <para>The ohmmeter measures resistance (ohms) in a circuit. Like the ammeter and voltmeter, analog and
                digital meters available. The Fluke 88&#8482; (DMM) is recommended. See Electronic Circuit Testing in
                this section.

            <specpara>
                <caution>
                    <para>The ohmmeter can only be used on circuits when the power is Off (power from 12-volt systems
                        may damage the meter). The ohmmeter has a low voltage power supply.

            </specpara>
            <para>Ohmmeters use a small battery to supply voltage and current flow through the circuit being tested.
                Based on Ohms Law, the Ohmmeter calculates resistance in the circuit by measuring voltage of the meter
                battery and the amount of current flow in the circuit. With the Fluke 88&#8482; (DMM), range selection
                and meter adjustment are not necessary.

            <para>To measure the resistance of a component or a circuit, remove power from the circuit.</para>
            <para>For a correct reading, isolate the component or circuit from other components or circuits so that
                meter current (from probe to probe) only flows through the component or selected circuit. When measuring
                resistance of the load, most of the current flow from the meter will flow through the indicator lamp
                because it has less resistance. To measure the load, remove one connector to the load. It is not always
                apparent when a component must be isolated, so it is a good practice to isolate a component or circuit
                by disconnecting one circuit.

            <para>Place ohmmeter leads across the component or circuit to display resistance in ohms (&#x2126;) . When
                checking a sensor or variable resistor such as fuel level gauge, heating the element or moving the arm
                should move the meter through a range of resistance that can be compared to a specification.

            <para>Electrical circuits can be checked for opens using an ohmmeter. Disconnected from the power supply to
                the circuit and isolate circuit from other circuits. Connect the meter to the open ends of the circuit
                as shown above. A high reading (infinity) indicates an open in the circuit. A near zero reading
                indicates a continuous circuit. The circuit between the light and the ground is disconnected. This
                precaution prevents reading a circuit as complete that may be shorted to ground ahead of the load
                device.

                the power source and the ground point.

            <para>Connect the ohmmeter between an isolated circuit and a good ground point to check the circuit for a
                short to ground. A short to ground will be indicated by a near zero reading, while a circuit not shorted
                to ground will cause a high meter reading. With the Fluke 88&#8482; (DMM), an open circuit will read
