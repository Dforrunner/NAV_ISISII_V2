        <title>CRUISE ON/OFF SWITCH IN OFF POSITION</title>
        <para>Momentarily placing this switch in the OFF position causes the signal from ECM terminal 50 to go through
            the Resistor Block (390), terminals F to E, where there is no resistor, then through the OFF terminal of the
            ON/OFF switch returning to ECM terminal 39. With the OFF switch depressed, the expected voltage drop in this
            circuit (measured between ECM terminals 39 and 50) is expected to be between 0 and 100mV.
            <emph type="bold">A voltage between 0 and 100mV is the signal the ECM expects to see with the OFF switch
                depressed.
            </emph>
        </para>
        <para>The Remote DISENGAGE PTO Switch is a normally open (NO) momentary switch that is wired parallel to the OFF
            side of the ON/ OFF switch. The PTO can only be turned on from the cab switch, but can be turned OFF from
            the remote location. When this switch is closed, the ECM expects to see the same signal as when the ON/OFF
            switch is in the OFF position (0 to 100mV voltage drop).
