        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Function</title>
            <para>The exhaust back pressure (EPB) sensor is included in the Navistar engine control system only when a
                vehicle is equipped with an exhaust back pressure valve.
            </para>
            <para>The ECM monitors the EBP signal during engine operation. The EBP's primary function is to measure
                exhaust back pressure so that the ECM can control the exhaust back pressure regulator when needed to aid
                in maintaining and achieving normal engine operating temperature.
            </para>
        </svcsubproc>
        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Operation</title>
            <para>The exhaust back pressure sensor is a variable capacitance sensor. When pressure is applied to the
                sensor, the capacitance changes in relation to the pressure.
            </para>
            <para>The ECM supplies a regulated 5 volt signal to terminal B of the EBP sensor from terminal 40 of the
                ECM. The EBP sensor is supplied a signal return (ground) at terminal A to terminal 19 of the ECM.
            </para>
            <para>During engine operation, exhaust back pressure acting on the sensor causes the sensor's capacitance to
                vary which changes the incoming 5 volt reference signal in relation to pressure. The sensor's pressure
                signal at terminal C is sent to terminal 1 of the ECM. This signal increases equally in proportion to an
                increase in pressure up to a maximum of 38 PSI (262 kPa).
            </para>
        </svcsubproc>
        <svcsubproc>
            <title>ECM DIAGNOSTICS</title>
            <para>The ECM continuously monitors the signal from the EBP sensor to ensure the signal is within the
                correct operating range. If the signal is lower or higher than required, the ECM will set a fault code.
                This fault code is retrieved using the Electronic Service Tool (EST) or by reading the flash code using
                the STI diagnostic switch. If the ignition key is shut off, the code will be stored as an inactive code.

            <para>Code 341 indicates the ECM has detected a EBP signal voltage less than .039 volts for more than 0.1
                seconds. If this fault code is set, the ECM will ignore the EBP signal and continue to operate normally,
                however, if the fault is active the ECM will disable exhaust back pressure valve operation

            <para>An out of range high code will be set if the ECM detects a voltage more than 4.9 volts for more than
                0.1 seconds. If this fault code is set, the ECM will ignore the EBP signal and continue to operate
                normally. If this fault is active, the ECM will disable exhaust back pressure operation.

            <para>Code 342 may be caused by an open signal return circuit, a short to a voltage source or a defective
                EBP sensor.

            <para>Code 344 may be caused by a defective or plugged EBP sensor or a restriction in the tube leading to
                the sensor. To confirm this, remove sensor and/or tube and inspect for carbon deposits.
