            <para>Diagnostic analysis involves certain checks that are simple and easily performed. These checks usually
                reveal the most frequently encountered causes of faulty operation. The data obtained must be related to
                the complaint. A failure may be due to a chain of conditions that no one thought important enough to
                report. The repair must include the discovery of the true cause of the complaint and the corrective
                measures necessary to correct the condition.
            </para>
            <para>The key to successful diagnostic analysis is the mental matching of the information of the condition
                with a complete knowledge of how the engine and all its components operate and their inter-relationship.
