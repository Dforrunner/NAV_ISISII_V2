            <para>The ECM monitors the timing of the EF signal while the engine is running. When it detects a fault sent
                from the IDM, it will log the transfer. However, it will be necessary to perform an Engine Off Standard
                Test to determine most fault codes stored in the IDM. The Engine Off Test may be initiated by the
                Electronic Service Tool or the STI Self Test Input switch located on the vehicle dash.
            </para>
            <para>The ECM continually measures the communication signal voltage levels. If the voltage levels are lower
                or higher than expected, a fault code will be set to identify the circuit or component. The fault will
                be automatically recorded as an active code. If the ignition key is turned off, the fault will be stored
                as an inactive code.

            <title>FLASH CODE 242 - ATA CODE SID 154 FMI 11 - FDCS CIRCUIT TO IDM OCC SELF TEST FAILED</title>
            <para>During the Engine Off Standard Output Circuit Check test, Code 242 will be set by the ECM, if the ECM
                did not detect a voltage transition on the FDCS circuit. This code will not cause the Engine Warning
                light to be illuminated.
            </para>
            <para>Code 242 may be caused by a shorted high or low or open FDCS circuit. If accompanied by other
                communication codes could indicate the IDM is not powered up. This fault must be repaired for the engine
                to operate.

            <title>FLASH CODE 253 - ATA CODE SID 153 FMI 11 - FUEL INJ SYNC CIRCUIT OCC SELF TEST FAILED</title>
            <para>Flash code 253 will be set during the Engine Off Standard Output Circuit Check test. This code is set
                by the ECM and indicates no voltage transition detected on the Cylinder Identification circuit. This
                fault will not cause the Engine Warning light to be illuminated.
            </para>
            <para>Possible causes are a shorted (high or low) or open CI circuit. If accompanied by other communication
                codes could indicate the IDM is not powered up. This fault must be repaired for the engine to run.

            <title>FLASH CODE 531 - ATA CODE SID 153 FMI 4 - FUEL INJ. SYNC SIGNAL LOW</title>
            <para>Flash code 531 is set by the IDM and is transmitted to the ECM on command from the ECM during the
                Engine Off Standard Test. This code indicates that the IDM has detected that the FDCS signal and the CI
                signal have remained at 0 volts. This code will cause the Engine Warning light to be illuminated.
            </para>
            <para>Possible cause may be a short to ground in the CI circuit. This fault must be repaired for the engine
                to run.

            <title>FLASH CODE 532 - ATA CODE SID 153 FMI 3 - FUEL INJ. SYNC SIGNAL HIGH</title>
            <para>Flash code 532 is set by the IDM and is transmitted to the ECM on command from the ECM during the
                Engine Off Standard Test. This code indicates the IDM has detected that the FDCS signal and CI signal
                have remained at 12 volts. This code will cause the Engine Warning light to be illuminated.
            </para>
            <para>Possible causes are a short to a voltage source or an open CI circuit. This fault must be repaired for
                the engine to run.

            <title>FLASH CODE 541 - ATA CODE SID 155 FMI 11 - IDM FEEDBACK TOGGLE NOT DETECTED BY ECM</title>
            <para>Flash code 541 is set by the ECM. The ECM monitors the CI, FDCS and EF signals for voltage levels. If
                the ECM detects that the CI or FDCS is open or if the EF signal is not sending a 100 Hz signal, this
                code will be set. This code will cause the Engine Warning light to be illuminated.
            </para>
            <para>Possible causes are a short or open on the EF circuit if this code is the only code present. If
                accompanied by other IDM circuit faults the IDM may not be powered or operational. If displayed during
                an Engine Off Standard Test it will be accompanied by code 543. This code may be set due to other faults
                in the ECM due to a reset condition. If other codes are present repair them first in the order of
                importance for engine operation. This code should not prevent engine operation by itself.

            <title>FLASH CODE 543 - ATA CODE SID 155 FMI 7 - IDM FAULTS NOT RECEIVED</title>
            <para>Flash code 543 is set by the ECM during an Engine Off Standard Output Circuit Check test. This
                indicates that the ECM has commanded the transmission of fault codes from the IDM and has not received
                the codes. If this code occurs, first record any active or inactive codes. Then clear the codes and
                rerun the Engine Off Standard Test. This code will cause the Engine Warning light to be illuminated.
            </para>
            <para>Possible causes for this code would be opens or shorts in the IDM/ECM communications circuits or an
                IDM not powered. If accompanied by other faults repair the other faults first in the order of importance
                for engine operation. This code should not prevent engine operation by itself (
