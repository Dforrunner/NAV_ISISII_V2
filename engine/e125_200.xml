        <title>NEUTRAL POSITION SWITCH</title>
        <para>With an Allison AT/MT automatic transmission, a normally open (NO) Neutral Position Switch is used to turn
            power ON or OFF in circuit 97AU.
        </para>
        <para>With the transmission in neutral, the switch is closed applying power to Crank Inhibit Relay terminal #1
            and to ECM terminal 10. On the circuit diagrams, ECM terminal 10 is labeled DDS (Driveline Disengagement
            Switch). The 12 volts at ECM terminal 10 tells the ECM that the Neutral Position switch is closed and that
            the transmission is in neutral.
        </para>
        <para>With an Allison WT (electronic transmission controls), the neutral position switch is not used as the
            Allison WT Electronic Control Module determines shifter position. With the transmission in neutral, ignition
            power from the transmission Vehicle Interface Module (VIM) Neutral Start Relay is delivered on circuit 97AU
            to the Crank Inhibit Relay at terminal #1. From terminal 1, circuit 97L/97A applies the ignition voltage to
            ECM DDS terminal 10.
        </para>
        <para>When the vehicle has an automatic transmission (AT or WT), the clutch switch connector has a jumper
            connecting circuits 97L and 97A, completing the circuit between Crank Inhibit Relay (385) terminal 1 and ECM
            terminal 10.
        </para>
        <para>With an automatic transmission, ECM terminal 10 is programmed to expect 12 volts on circuit 97A when the
            shifter is in neutral and 0 volts when the shifter is not in neutral. The circuit diagram table shows
            terminal voltages for various conditions and vehicle configurations.
        </para>
        <para>The Prolink 9000 can be used to monitor the Neutral Position Switch. When the switch is closed
            (transmission in neutral), the Prolink (using PTO/Clutch Switch Status) indicates clutch ON, meaning the
            driveline is disengaged.
