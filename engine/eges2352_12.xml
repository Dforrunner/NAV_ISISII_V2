            <para>The function of the cooling system is to keep the engine within a designated temperature range. Major
                components include a thermostat, EGR cooler, oil cooler, radiator and fan combination with a coolant
                (water) pump. The water pump is a belt-driven centrifugal type, which is contained in the front cover.
            </para>
            <para>The front cover incorporates several separate passages. Two passages channel coolant to the crankcase
                and heads from the water pump, two passages channel returning coolant from the crankcase and heads, and
                a bypass to route coolant back into the water pump when the thermostat is closed. See Appendix A for
                thermostat start-to-open temperature and fully open temperature.
            </para>
            <para>Coolant flows from the radiator into the inlet tube of the front cover and into the water pump. The
                coolant is pushed by the water pump, through the front cover and into the crankcase. Crankcase coolant
                flows from the front to the rear, and is evenly distributed around the cylinders and through the
                cylinder heads. Cylinder head coolant flows up from the rear to the front of the heads. Coolant returns
                to the front cover through passages in the crankcase.
            </para>
            <para>
                <emph type="bold">Thermostat Operation</emph>
            </para>
            <para>When the engine coolant temperature is below the specified start-to-open temperature (see Appendix A),
                the coolant flows through the bypass passage to the water pump because the radiator outlet port is
                blocked. As the engine reaches operating temperature, the thermostat opens, directing coolant through
                the radiator, and restricts the bypass opening.
