        <specpara>
            <note>
                <para>Bearing shells must fit tightly in the bore. When bearing shells are inserted into connecting rod
                    and cap, they protrude above parting line. This protrusion is required to achieve bearing crush.
                </para>
                <para>Bearing shells across open ends are slightly larger than the diameter of connecting rod bore into
                    which they are assembled. This condition is designed into bearing shell, causing it to spread
                    outward at parting line when bearing crush load is applied by tightening bolts. Some flexibility may
                    be lost in normal use, but bearing replacement is not required because of a nominal loss of
                    flexibility.
                </para>
                <para>When assembly is drawn up tight, bearing is compressed, ensuring positive contact between backside
                    of bearing and bore.
