        <para>The Slack Tube Manometer is a U-shaped tube with a scale mounted between the legs of the tube. When the
            portability of the gauge bar tool is not required, this manometer is used to measure low vacuum for intake
            restriction or low pressure for crankcase or exhaust back pressure.

        </para>
        <para>Fill the manometer with water before checking pressure. Use only drinking water without additives. Add
            some colored water vegetable dye so the scale can be read more easily. With both legs of the manometer open
            to the atmosphere, fill the tube until the top of the fluid column is near the zero mark on the scale. Shake
            the tube to eliminate any air bubbles.

            <para count="1">Support the manometer vertically. Make sure the fluid level is in line with the zero

            <para count="1">Start the engine and allow it to reach normal operating temperature. Then run the engine to
                high idle. The manometer can be read after 10 seconds.

            <para count="1">Record the average position of the fluid level when it is above and below the zero
                indicator. Add the two figures together. The sum of the two is the total column of fluid (distance A).
                This represents the crankcase pressure in inches of water (in H
                <subscript>2</subscript>O).
            </para>
            <para>At times, both columns of the manometer will not travel the same distance. This is no concern if the
                leg not connected to the pressure or vacuum source is open to the atmosphere.
