        <para>The ohmmeter is used to measure resistance (ohms) in a circuit. Like the ammeter and voltmeter, there are
            both analog and digital meters available. It is recommended that the digital meter (Fluke 88 DVOM) be used.
            See ELECTRONIC CIRCUIT TESTING in this section.

            <caution>
                <para>the ohmmeter can only be used on circuits where power has been removed. the meter contains its own
                    low voltage power supply and the power from 12-volt systems may damage the meter.
                </para>
            </caution>
        </specpara>
        <para>Ohmmeters use a small battery to supply the voltage and current which flow through the circuit being
            tested. The voltage of the meter battery and the amount of current flow in the circuit are used with Ohms
            Law and the meter calculates the circuit resistance which is displayed by the meter. With the Fluke 88 DVOM,
            range selection and meter adjustment are not necessary.
