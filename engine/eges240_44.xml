            <para>Continuous Monitor is (a series of continuous diagnostic tests) done by the Electronic Control Module
                (ECM) to detect failure modes (Out of Range, In Range, and System Faults). During Continuous Monitor the
                ignition key is on.

            <para>If an input signal is out of range, over or under normal operating range, the ECM records and sets a
                Diagnostic Trouble Code (DTC). The ECM monitors the operation of systems for in range conditions to
                determine if systems are working in a normal operational range; If the ECM detects that a system falls
                outside a predetermined range, it will record a fault and set a DTC.
            </para>
            <para>Each DTC has a three digit number to identify the source of a malfunction measured or monitored
                electronically.
            </para>
            <para>The ECM continuously monitors the Injection Control Pressure (ICP) system and the Air Management
                System (AMS) . If the ECM detects that a system falls outside a predetermined range, the ECM records a
                fault and sets a DTC.
            </para>
            <para>A fault is a malfunction measured or monitored electronically. Faults are recorded as DTCs.</para>
            <para>During normal engine operation, the ECM automatically performs several tests to detect faults. When a
                fault is detected, the ECM often runs a fault management strategy to allow continued, though sometimes
                degraded, vehicle operation.
