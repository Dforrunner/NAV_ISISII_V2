        <title>FUNCTION</title>
        <para>The Navistar engine control system includes a Engine Coolant Temperature sensor. The ECM measures the
            Engine Coolant Temperature signal and uses this information for Coolant Temperature Compensation and
            optional high temperature warning and shut down systems.
        </para>
        <para>Coolant Temperature Compensation is used to protect the engine if the coolant temperature is too high. The
            ECM monitors the ECT signal to determine the coolant temperature. If the coolant reaches 214&#176; F(101&#176;C
            ), the ECM will reduce the fuel delivery by 6% for each Celsius degree of temperature increase. If the
            coolant temperature increases to 218&#176;F(104&#176;C), fuel quantity will be reduced 3% for each Celsius
            degree of temperature increase. Coolant Temperature Compensation can be programmed to be inoperative in
            certain applications where full engine performance is required over the protection of the engine.
        </para>
        <para>On engines equipped with an engine warning system, the ECM will activate the audible warning alarm and
            illuminate the red Oil/Water warning light when the engine coolant temperature reaches 225&#176;F (107&#176;C).
        </para>
        <para>On engines equipped with an engine shut down system, the ECM will shut the engine off when the coolant
            temperature reaches 235&#176;F (112.5&#176;C). The vehicle operator may restart the engine by turning the
            ignition key "OFF" and then restarting it. Upon restart, the ECM will allow the engine to run for an
            additional 30 seconds, before shutting off the engine again.
