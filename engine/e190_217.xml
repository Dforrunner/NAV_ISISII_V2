        <para>The Engine Coolant temperature sensor is a thermistor type sensor which changes resistance when exposed to
            different temperatures.
        </para>
        <para>When the temperature of the coolant is decreased, the resistance of the thermistor increases which causes
            the signal voltage to increase. As the temperature of the coolant is increased the resistance of the
            thermistor decreases, which causes the signal voltage to decrease.
        </para>
        <para>The ECT sensor is supplied a regulated 5 volt reference voltage from the ECM. The sensor is grounded at
            terminal A through the signal return terminal at the ECM. As the coolant temperature increases or decreases,
            the sensor changes resistance and provides the ECM with the coolant temperature signal voltage at the ECM.
            This signal voltage is then read by the ECM to determine the temperature of the coolant.
