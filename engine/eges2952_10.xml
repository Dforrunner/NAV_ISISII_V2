            </para>
            <para>A gear driven, high-pressure oil pump draws oil through a screen in the oil reservoir for the
                high-pressure oil pump. The oil reservoir, in the top of the crankcase below the oil cooler, is kept
                full by the engine lubrication system.
            </para>
            <para>The IPR valve maintains the ICP pressure by dumping excess oil back to the crankcase.</para>
            <para>High-pressure oil from the pump flows through a branch tube assembly to each case-to-head tube
                assembly to each high-pressure oil rail.
            </para>
            <para>High-pressure oil in the oil rails enter the fuel injectors through sealed ports in the top of the
                fuel injectors.
            </para>
            <para>When the OPEN coil for each injector is energized, the injector uses high-pressure oil to inject and
                atomize fuel into the combustion chamber. The CLOSE coils are energized to end injection. Exhaust oil
                exits through two ports in the top of the injector and drains back to the crankcase.

            </figure>
            <para>The ICP is a closed loop system that uses the ICP sensor to provide feedback to the ECM. The ECM uses
                the ICP sensor to continuously monitor ICP and adjust the duty cycle to the IPR to match engine
                requirements.

                <title>ICP system operation</title>
            </para>
            <para>The solenoid receives a pulse width modulated signal from the ECM that indicates the on/off time the
                control valve is energized. The pulse is modulated to control ICP pressure in the range of 3 to 20 MPa
                (500 to 3,000 psi).
            </para>
            <para>The IPR valve is mounted in the high-pressure pump cover. The IPR valve maintains the desired ICP by
                dumping excess oil out the bottom of the high-pressure pump cover.
            </para>
            <para>High-pressure oil is routed to the IPR valve and ICP sensor through the discharge tube and passages in
                the high-pressure pump cover.
            </para>
            <para>As the demand for ICP increases, the ECM increases the pulse width to the IPR solenoid. When ICP
                demand decreases, the ECM decreases the (duty cycle) to the solenoid, allowing oil to flow from the
                drain orifice.
            </para>
            <para>The ECM sets Diagnostic Trouble Codes (DTCs), if the ICP electrical signal is out of range. DTCs are
                also set if an ICP signal corresponds to an out of range value for injection control pressure for a
                given operating condition.
            </para>
            <para>The ECM will ignore ICP signals that are out of range. The IPR valve will operate from preprogrammed
                default values. This is called an Open Loop Operation.
