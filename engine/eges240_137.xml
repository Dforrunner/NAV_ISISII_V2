            <para>Many factors can influence the combustion process in a power cylinder and thereby affect the
                production of torque or horsepower from that cylinder. These factors include piston and cylinder
                geometry, injector performance, and rail pressure. Variations in any of these factors can lead to
                unevenness in torque and horsepower from one cylinder to the next. Power cylinder unevenness can result
                in increased engine noise and vibration, especially at low idle conditions. This is also referred to as
                rough idle.
            </para>
            <para>The IDM utilizes a Cylinder Balance control strategy in an attempt to even the power contribution of
                the cylinders, particularly at low idle conditions. This strategy incorporates information from the
                crankshaft position system. The IDM uses the instantaneous engine speed near Top Dead Center (TDC) for
                each cylinder as an indication of that cylinder's power contribution. The IDM computes a nominal
                instantaneous engine speed value based on all cylinders. The nominal value would be the expected value
                from all cylinders if the engine is balanced. By knowing the error quantities, the IDM can add or
                subtract fuel from a particular cylinder. The control strategy attempts to correct the cylinder
                unbalance by using fuel quantity compensation through adjustments of the pulse width values for each
                fuel injector. This method of compensation is repeated until all error quantities are close to zero
                causing all cylinders to contribute the same amount.

                <title>Fault Detection / Management</title>
            </para>
            <para>While the engine is running, the IDM is constantly monitoring the crankshaft position system and can
                determine if the engine requires to be balanced. A DTC for Cylinder Balance will be set if the IDM is
                unable to balance the engine.
            </para>
            <para>If a DTC for Cylinder Balance is set active, the IDM will turn off the Cylinder Balance strategy until
                the next key on cycle.
            </para>
            <para>If a DTC for injector circuit is set active, the IDM will turn off the Cylinder Balance strategy. When
                the DTC changes to inactive the Cylinder Balance control will reset to on.
