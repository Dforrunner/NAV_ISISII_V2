        <para>The CMP (Camshaft Position) sensor is a Hall Effect type sensor that generates a digital frequency as
            windows on the timing disk pass through its magnetic field. The frequency of the windows passing by the
            sensor as well as the width of selected windows allows the ECM to detect engine speed and position.
        </para>
        <para>
            <emph type="BOLD">Engine Speed -</emph>
            Is determined by counting 24 windows on the timing sensor disk each camshaft revolution.
        </para>
        <para>
            <emph type="BOLD">Fuel Timing Control -</emph>
            The position of cylinder #1 is determined by distinguishing a narrow vane on the camshaft timing sensor
            disk.
        </para>
        <para>
            <emph type="BOLD">Engine Mode Selection -</emph>
            Allows the ECM to discern when the engine is in the off, crank or run mode.
        </para>
        <para>
            <emph type="BOLD">Injection Control Pressure -</emph>
            Engine speed is one of the controlling variables in the calculation of desired injection control pressure.
        </para>
        <para>
            <emph type="BOLD">Exhaust Back Pressure -</emph>
            Exhaust Back Pressure control is a function of engine speed and load.
        </para>
        <para>
            <emph type="BOLD">Fuel Quantity Control/Torque Limiting -</emph>
            Engine torque and fuel is controlled and is dependent on engine speed. Fuel quantity is determined by engine
            speed.
