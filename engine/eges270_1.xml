    <svcdiag>
        <para>Service diagnosis is a systematic procedure of investigation to be followed in order to locate and correct
            an engine problem. The engine is first considered as a complete unit in its specific application and then
            the problem is localized to components or systems; intake, exhaust, cooling, lubrication or injection.
            Testing procedures will then help analyze the source of the problem.

        <para>Although the cause of an engine failure may be apparent, very often the real cause is not found until a
            repeat failure occurs. This can be prevented if specific diagnostic action is taken before, during and after
            engine disassembly and during engine assembly.
        </para>
        <para>It is also very important that specific diagnostic tests follow engine assembly before and after the

                    water, or a good hand cleaner. Wash or properly throw away clothing or rags containing used engine
                    fluids. Used engine fluids contain certain elements that may be unhealthy for skin and could even
                    cause cancer.
