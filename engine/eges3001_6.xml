            <para>The International&#174; VT 275 is a V6 engine with a displacement of 4.5 liters (275 cubic inches).
            </para>
            <para>The cylinder heads have four valves per cylinder for improved air flow. Each fuel injector is
                centrally located between the four valves and directs fuel over the piston bowl for improved performance
                and reduced emissions.
            </para>
            <para>The overhead valve train includes hydraulic roller cam followers, push rods, rocker arms, and valve
                bridges to open the dual intake and exhaust valves.
            </para>
            <para>The crankcase assembly has been designed as two major matching components. The upper crankcase half
                houses the cylinders, main bearing saddles, with oil and coolant passages either cast or machined. The
                lower crankcase consists of a structural plate with the main bearing caps machined into it for improved
                load retention and alignment.
            </para>
            <para>The crankshaft is supported by four main bearings with fore and aft thrust controlled at the upper
                half of the number 3 main bearing. Two connecting rods are attached to each crankshaft rod journal and
                are offset to minimize vibration. Piston pins are free floating, allowing the pin free lateral movement
                within the connecting rod as well as the piston. Piston pins and are held in place with retaining rings.
            </para>
            <para>The camshaft is supported by four bushings pressed into the crankcase. The camshaft is crankshaft
                driven and thrust is controlled by a plate mounted behind the number four cam journal.
            </para>
            <para>The primary balancer shaft fits and turns within the camshaft itself and is driven by the crankshaft
                flange. A counterweight is bolted to the front of the balancer shaft and is held in place by the thrust
                plate. The camshaft thrust plate aligns and holds the rear end of the balance shaft in the crankcase.
            </para>
            <para>The Crankshaft Position (CKP) sensor and Camshaft Position (CMP) sensor are used by the Electronic
                Control Module (ECM) and Injector Drive Module (IDM) to calculate rpm, fuel timing, fuel quantity, and
                duration of fuel injection.
            </para>
            <para>One piece aluminum-alloy pistons are fitted with one keystone ring, one rectangular intermediate
                compression ring, and a two piece oil control ring.
            </para>
            <para>The combustion bowl is located in the piston crown to reduce emissions. All pistons are mated to
                fractured cap joint connecting rods.
            </para>
            <para>The engine lubrication system is pressure regulated, full flow cooled, and full flow filtered. The
                crankshaft driven gerotor oil pump provides the necessary pressure to protect all the bearings and other
                wear surfaces. The oil pressure regulator, in the front cover, maintains the desired system pressure.
                The oil cooler cover and oil filter base assemblies direct oil and coolant flow for purpose of heat
                exchange.
            </para>
            <para>The International&#174; electro-hydraulic generation 2 injection system includes a cast iron oil rail
                assembly, fuel injectors, and a high-pressure oil pump. The IDM electronically controls the injectors.
                The IDM sends voltage pulses to the opening and closing coils of each injector to control fueling. The
                IDM receives input information from the ECM to determine timing, quantity, and duration of fuel for each
                injection event.
            </para>
            <para>An electronic Boost Control Solenoid (BCS) in combination with a pneumatic actuator controls the
                turbocharger.
            </para>
            <para>An open crankcase breather system draws crankcase vapors through a breather element while separating
                the vapor to the atmosphere and returning oil to the crankcase.
            </para>
            <para>The secondary fuel filter assembly is pressure regulated and incorporates an air bleed orifice
                allowing air to be automatically purge if it has been introduced to the system.
