        <title>ECM DIAGNOSTICS</title>
        <para>The ECM continuously monitors the signal from the EOP sensor to ensure the signal is within the correct
            operating range. If the signal is lower or higher than required, the ECM will set a fault code. This fault
            code is retrieved using the Electronic Service Tool (EST) or by reading the flash code using the STI
            diagnostic switch. If the ignition key is shut off, the code will be stored as an inactive code.
        </para>
        <para>During engine operation, the ECM also monitors the engine speed signal. It compares the expected oil
            pressure specification versus engine speed. If the ECM detects that the oil pressure is lower for a given
            engine speed, the ECM will set a fault code. If the pressure is lower than the "critical" level, the ECM
            will record a fault code. The ECM will automatically record this as a low oil pressure "Event" which is
            stored in the ECM memory and cannot be erased using the EST. This becomes a record of operation of the
            engine.

            However, if the fault is Active, the ECM will turn on the Engine Warning light.

        <para>Code 225 will be set by the ECM, if the signal from the EOP sensor is higher than expected with the key on
            and the engine off (a signal that indicates 40 psi). If the ECM detects this fault, it will ignore the EOP
            signal and illuminate the Engine Warning Lamp. This code most likely will be set, because of a defective EOP
            sensor or a biased circuit.

        <para>Code 313 indicates that the oil pressure has dropped below the warning level. The specification for the
            warning level is 5.0 PSI (34kPa) @ 700 RPM or 10.0 PSI (69 kPa) @ 1400 RPM or 20.0 PSI (138 kPa) @ 2000 RPM.

        <para>Code 313 may be caused by a defective sensor sending an incorrect signal. To confirm this, compare actual
            oil pressure (with a mechanical gauge) to the reading on the data list of the EST. Low oil pressure due to
            defective mechanical components will also set this code.

        <para>If flash code 314 is set, this indicates that the oil pressure has dropped below the critical level. The

            (152 kPa) @ 2000 RPM.

        <para>Code 314 may be caused by a defective sensor sending an incorrect signal. To confirm this, compare actual

            pressure due to defective mechanical components will also set this code.
