            <para id="EWPS">The EWPS safeguards the engine from undesirable operating conditions to prevent engine
                damage and to prolong engine life. When a warning condition is detected, the on-board electronics will
                illuminate the red ENGINE lamp.
            </para>
            <para>When a critical engine condition is detected, the on-board electronics will shut the engine down if
                the protection feature has been enabled. The critical engine condition will be recorded by a logging
                feature that records the event in engine hours and odometer readings. After the engine has shutdown, the
                engine may be restarted for a thirty second run time.
