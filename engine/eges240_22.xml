        <para>A thermistor sensor changes its electrical resistance to temperature. Resistance in the thermistor
            decreases as temperature increases, and increases as temperature decreases. Thermistors work with a resistor
            that limits current in the ECM to form a voltage signal matched with a temperature value.
        </para>
        <para>The top half of the voltage divider is the current limiting resistor that is internal to the ECM. A
            thermistor sensor has two electrical connectors, signal return and ground. The output of a thermistor sensor
            is a non-linear analog signal.

            Variable capacitance sensors measure pressure. The pressure measured is applied to a ceramic material. The
            pressure forces the ceramic material closer to a thin metal disk. This action changes the capacitance of the
            sensor.

            <title></title>A magnetic pickup sensor generates an alternating frequency that indicates speed. Magnetic
            pickups have a two wire connection for signal and ground. This sensor has a permanent magnetic core

            missing. From the CKP signal frequency compared to the CMP signal frequency, the ECM can calculate engine
            rpm and timing requirements. The CKP is installed in the front right side of the lower crankcase.

        <para>A potentiometer is a variable voltage divider that senses the position of a mechanical component. A
            reference voltage is applied to one end of the potentiometer. Mechanical rotary or linear motion moves the
            wiper along the resistance material, changing voltage at each point along the resistive material. Voltage is
            proportional to the amount of mechanical movement.

        <para>Switch sensors indicate position. They operate open or closed, allowing or preventing the flow of current.
            A switch sensor can be a voltage input switch or a grounding switch. A voltage input switch supplies the ECM
            with a voltage when it is closed. A grounding switch grounds the circuit closed, causing a zero voltage
            signal. Grounding switches are usually installed in series with a current limiting resistor.
