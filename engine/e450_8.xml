                            manifold. During engine operation leaks at the connectors can cause manifold pressure to be
                            reduced at the aneroid which allows the injection pump to operate in "cut back" or reduced
                            power level. However, slight manifold pressure leakage is allowable on pressure side of the
                            intake system, such as at the turbocharger compressor housing, as long as manifold pressure
                            meets Performance Data Guidelines.

                            result if diaphragm leaks because injection pump will stay in "cut back" position.
