            <caution>
                <para>To avoid engine damage, use a ribbed seal when assembling a connector. A connector assembled
                    without the appropriate ribbed seal may become contaminated with moisture. Terminal corrosion may
                    result, resulting in a poor electrical connection.
                </para>
                <para>Before installing the connector, make sure each connector has its ribbed seal in place. In some
                    cases, upon disassembly, a ribbed seal may pull off of its connector and remain in the mating socket
                    of a sensor or actuator.
