        <title>POWER TAKE OFF SPEED CONTROL</title>
        <para>Power Take Off (PTO) Speed Control provides a method for the operator to set and maintain a regulated
            engine speed, without using the accelerator pedal, for the purpose of operating auxiliary equipment. The
            power take off feature has a In-Cab and a remote operator interface. Depending upon configuration, the
            operator may turn on and activate PTO speed control while in the comfort of the cab or at the convenience of
            the remote interface. If both In-Cab and remote operations are both enabled, the on-board electronics senses
            which interface is active depending on operator actions. No active mobile PTO operation is possible when the
            PTO speed control is turned on using the remote interface.
        </para>
        <para>This feature also has the "bump up" and "bump down" functions. Wherein, the operator may "bump up" the RPM
            in 25 RPM increments when the Resume/Accel button is momentarily pressed. The operator may "bump down" the
            RPM in 25 RPM increments when the Set/Coast button is momentarily pressed.
