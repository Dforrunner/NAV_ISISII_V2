        <para>A thermistor sensor changes its electrical resistance with changes in temperature. Resistance in the
            thermistor decreases as temperature increases, and increases as temperature decreases. Thermistors work with
            a resistor that limits current in the ECM to form a voltage signal matched with a temperature value.
        </para>
        <para>The top half of the voltage divider is the current limiting resistor inside the ECM. A thermistor sensor
            has two electrical connectors, signal return and ground. The output of a thermistor sensor is a nonlinear
            analog signal.

        <para>Switch sensors indicate position, level, or status. They operate open or closed, allowing or preventing
            the flow of current. A switch sensor can be a voltage input switch or a grounding switch. A voltage input
            switch supplies the ECM with a voltage when it is closed. A grounding switch grounds the circuit when
            closed, causing a zero voltage signal. Grounding switches are usually installed in series with a current
            limiting resistor.

            <title>Driveline Disengagement Switch (DDS)</title>
        </para>
        <para>The DDS determines if a vehicle is in gear. For manual transmissions, the clutch switch serves as the DDS.
            For automatic transmissions, the neutral indicator switch or datalink communication functions as the DDS.

            <title>Engine Coolant Level (ECL)</title>
        </para>
        <para>ECL is part of the Engine Warning Protection System (EWPS). The ECL switch is used in plastic deaeration
            tanks. When a magnetic switch is open, the tank is full.

        <para>
            <title>Idle Validation Switch (IVS)</title>
        </para>
        <para>The IVS is a redundant switch that provides the ECM with a signal that verifies when the APS is in the
            idle position.
        </para>
        <para>
            <title>Water In Fuel (WIF)</title>
        </para>
        <para>A Water In Fuel (WIF) sensor in the element cavity of the fuel filter housing detects water. When enough
            water accumulates in the element cavity, the WIF sensor signal changes to the Electronic Control Module
            (ECM). The ECM sends a message to illuminate the amber water and fuel lamp, alerting the operator. The WIF
            is installed in the base of the fuel filter housing.
