        <para>The manometer is a U-shaped tube with a scale mounted between the legs of the U. When the portability of
            the gauge bar tool is not required, this manometer is used to measure either low pressure or vacuum (intake
            restriction, crankcase pressure or exhaust back pressure).

            <emph type="bold">Filling</emph>
        </para>
        <para>The manometer must be filled with water before checking any pressure. Use only drinking water without
            additives. Add some colored water vegetable dye so the scale can be read more easily. With both legs of the
            manometer open to the atmosphere, fill the tube until the top of the fluid column is near the zero mark on
            the scale. Shake the tube to eliminate any air bubbles.
        </para>
        <specpara>
            <note>
                <para>Never fill the manometer with an antifreeze solution, soda pop, tonic, etc. The increase in
                    density causes false readings.

            <para count="1">Support the manometer in a vertical position. Make sure the fluid level is in line with the

            <para count="1">Start the engine and allow it to reach normal operating temperature. Then run the engine to
                high idle. The manometer can be observed after approximately 10 seconds.

            <para count="1">Record the average position of the fluid level when it is above and below the zero
                indicator. Add the two figures together. The sum of the two is the total column of fluid (distance A).
                This represents the crankcase pressure in inches of water (in H
                <subscript>2</subscript>O).
            </para>
            <para>At times, both columns of the manometer will not travel the same distance. This is of no concern as
                long as the leg that is not connected to the pressure or vacuum source is open to the atmosphere.
