            <para>The EVRT&#174; Electronically Controlled Turbocharger features actuated turbine vanes. These vanes
                modify the flow characteristics of exhaust gases that pass through the turbine housing. Among the
                advantages of the EVRT&#174; is its ability to precisely alter the boost pressure necessary to
                accommodate various engine speed and load conditions. The EVRT&#174; also allows for lower emissions.

                <note>
                    <para>The control valve and solenoid assembly is the only serviceable component on the EVRT&#174;
                        Electronically Controlled Turbocharger. When a failure is isolated to components other than the
                        control valve and solenoid assembly, the complete EVRT&#174; assembly must be replaced.

            <para>The EVRT&#174; is a closed loop system that uses the Manifold Air Pressure (MAP) sensor to provide
                input to the Electronic Control Module (ECM). The ECM provides the required duty cycle to control the
                EVRT&#174; in response to engine speed and load. Continuous monitoring and evaluation of these variables
                allows for optimal duty cycle adjustment to match engine requirements.
            </para>
            <para>The solenoid receives a pulse width modulated signal (duty cycle) that indicates the amount of time
                the control valve is energized. This is also referred to as the on/off time. The control valve and
                solenoid assembly regulate the engine oil pressure from the filter header. The control valve directs oil
                flow to both sides of the piston within the center housing.

            <para>The unison ring links all of the turbine vanes and controls vane position. When the unison ring moves,
                each vane moves accordingly. The actuated vanes are mounted around the internal circumference of the
                turbine housing. Redirection of the oil to different sides of the piston will result in movement of the
                unison ring. This will result in the desired increase or decrease in manifold pressure.
