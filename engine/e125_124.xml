        <title>APS AUTO-CALIBRATION</title>
        <para>The ECM learns the lowest and highest pedal positions by reading and storing the minimum and maximum
            voltage levels from the APS. In this manner the ECM "auto- calibrates" the system to allow maximum pedal
            sensitivity. The ECM auto-calibrates as the key is ON, but when the key is turned OFF, these values are
            lost. When the key is turned on again, this process starts over. When the pedal is disconnected (or new one
            installed), the pedal does not need to be calibrated, as the calibration happens when the key is turned on.
