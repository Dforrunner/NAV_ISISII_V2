            <para>Valve train failures from broken or bent push rods, valves, rocker arms and worn valve keepers and/or
                rotators in many instances could be caused by improper timing of the gear train. Depending on valve lash
                setting, if the camshaft gear is improperly timed by one (1) tooth early, the engine pistons will strike
                the intake valve heads or if the timing is set one (1) tooth late, the exhaust valve may contact
                pistons.
