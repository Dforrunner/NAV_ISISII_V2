            <para>Lube oil is drawn from the oil pan through an oil pickup screen and tube to the oil pump. The oil then
                goes through the oil cooler and flows around the outside of the heat exchange tubes (cooler bundle),
                rearward to the oil filter header. At the oil filter header the oil meets the pressure regulator valve.

                    <para>The oil pressure regulator valve controls the volume and pressure of the filtered oil supplied
                        to the engine. The volume of oil supplied by the oil pump is in excess of what is needed to
                        lubricate the engine. Excess unfiltered oil is returned to the sump by the pressure regulator
                        valve, keeping lube oil pressure within specified limits.
