        <para>The Hydraulic Pressure Governor (HPG) is an optional feature used for closed loop control of hydraulic
            pressure based on an external hydraulic pressure input and a programmable desired hydraulic pressure. This
            feature is targeted for fluid delivery pumps, especially fire truck applications.
        </para>
        <para>The HPG feature is active when no HPS (hydraulic pressure sensor) signal fault exists, the driveline is in
            its proper state (which is dependent on the type of pump used), the vehicle is stationary and its
            corresponding programmable parameter is turned on.
        </para>
        <para>When the HPG feature is first initiated, the desired hydraulic pressure is ramped up at a programmable
            ramp rate. The limited desired pressure (set point) is then used along with the actual hydraulic pressure
            signal (feedback) to control desired engine speed required to achieve the desired hydraulic pressure.
