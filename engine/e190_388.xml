            <note>
                <para>The purpose of this section is to diagnose the two speed interface with the speedometer. This
                    section does not diagnose two speed axle operation.

        <para>The vehicle speed sensor reads the revolutions of the transmission speedometer gear and sends a signal to
            the ECM. ECM programming includes the high and low rear axle ratios. The ECM uses the sensor input and rear
            axle rations to calculate the speedometer signal, depending on which range the vehicle is operating in. When
            voltage is applied to ECM pin 28 from the two speed circuit, the ECM uses the low ratio.
        </para>
        <para>The Two Speed Axle switch receives ACC. power from 10A fuse F14. This is a normally open switch with
            "High" as the normal operating position. With the Two-Speed switch in the "Low" position, 12V accessory
            power is applied through ECM connector (381) at ECM pin 28.
