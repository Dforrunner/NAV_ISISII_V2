<p>At this window, you can perform any one of 3 searches to find and select a desired document.
<ul>
    <li>Search1
        <br>Select the Major Component, Model, and or Vendor that you want to find information for.
        <br>If you select ALL for all 3 columns you will get a list of all titles available.
    </li>

        <br>If you select ALL for Engine you will get a list of all titles available within the Engine group (Group 12).
    </li>
    <li>Search3
        <br>Select the Feature Code that you want to find information for.
        <br>If you select ALL for Feature Code you will get a list of all titles that have a specific feature code
        specified.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Make a selection and click the appropriate Search button.
<p>The following window may pop up on your screen. It is normal. This is because the program is reading the service
    information from your PC (or CD). Click Yes.
<p><IMG Src="cd02.gif">
<p>If no information was found you will get message similar to the following. You can then click the Back button and
    modify your selection criteria.
<p><IMG Src="cd03.gif">
<p>Otherwise, a window will be displayed showing the information that pertains to the selection that was made. The
    selection criteria is also displayed for reference.
<p>Note that the information is grouped as follows (see the next 2 screens for example):
<ol>
    <li>Master Service Manual (Truck Group)</li>
    <li>Master Service Manual (Engine Group)</li>
    <li>Vehicle Recall Campaigns</li>
    <li>Authorized Field Change (AFC) Letters</li>
    <li>Technical Service Information (TSI) Letters</li>
</ol>
<p><IMG Src="cd04.gif">
<p><IMG Src="cd05.gif">
<p>If a particular category doesn't show up, then no information was found for that category that pertained to the
    selection criteria.
<p>If some of the information is only available on a different CD than the one currently being used, you will get one of
    the following two screens, with the applicable documents shown by name, but not linked. You will need to use the
    other CD to get the information.
    If you do the full setup from both CDs, then all information should be available all the time.
<p><IMG Src="cd05a.gif">
<p>Note also that some of the options are not available in the left side navigation menu when the second CD is being
    used.
