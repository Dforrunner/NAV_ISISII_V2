<h3>Uninstalling the Graphic Viewer</h3>
<p>If ActiveCGM has previously been loaded on this PC, you may need to uninstall it before doing the reload.
<p>Go to a Command (DOS) prompt.
<p>Go to the main windows drive. Type "c:" if you are not already at the "c" prompt.
<p>Change directories to the Windows directory. It probably is "cd winnt".
<p>Type "regsvr32 /u acgm.dll"
<p>Wait a couple of seconds and you should get a message that the control was unregistered.
