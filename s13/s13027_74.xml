        <title>OPERATING TEMPERATURES</title>
        <para>The transmission should not be operated consistently at temperatures above 250&#176;F (120&#176;C).
            However, intermittent operating temperatures to 300&#176;F (149&#176;C) will not harm the transmission.
            Operating temperatures above 250&#176;F increase the lubricant's rate of oxidation and shorten its effective
            life. When the average operating temperature is above 250&#176;F, the transmission may require more frequent
            oil changes or external cooling.
        </para>
        <para>The following conditions in any combination can cause operating temperatures of over 250&#176;F: (1)
            operating consistently at slow speeds, (2) high ambient temperatures, (3) restricted air flow around
            transmission, (4) exhaust system too close to transmission, (5) high horsepower, overdrive operation.
        </para>
        <para>External oil coolers are available to reduce operating temperatures when the above conditions are
            encountered.
