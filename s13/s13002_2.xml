            <title>VIBRATION</title>
            <para>Vibration is a condition which can be difficult to trace and isolate. The effects of vibration will
                cause transmission problems, even though it originates somewhere else in the system. Intermittent
                vibration can be isolated under specific conditions of engine idle, RPM, gear selection, load and speed.
                Constant vibration should vary with engine RPM, load and speed to provide clues to its source.

                <para count="1">A loose output shaft nut. Examine the splines of the output shaft for shiny areas which
                    indicate end yoke movement.

            <step1>
                <para count="1">A rough idling engine. This will produce pulsation and gear train vibration as mainshaft
                    gears mesh with mating gears. This condition is referred to as noise in neutral or while idling.

            <step1>
                <para count="1">Loose or broken engine mounts. Loose or broken mounts will produce a vibration that
                    appears to be in the transmission.

                    of balance and excessive shaft length. These will contribute to a vibration complaint.
