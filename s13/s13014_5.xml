        <para>Hammering on end yokes and flanges to remove or install them is not only destructive to the yoke or flange
            itself, but can also cause serious internal damage. Hammering destroys or mutilates the pilot diameters and
            warps or bends the flange. Hammering on end yokes will close-in the bearing bores or misalign yoke lugs and
            result in early failures of journal needle bearings, etc.
        </para>
        <para>Serious damage can be done internally to bearings, thrust faces and washers, pilot bearings, etc., by
            hammering on external parts.
        </para>
        <para>In most designs when the yoke/flange locknuts are tightened and secure, the internal bearings and gears
            are in proper location. When the yoke/flange is driven on the shaft, two conditions can exist:
