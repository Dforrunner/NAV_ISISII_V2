        <title>INSTALLATION AND REMOVAL OF BEARINGS</title>
        <para>Improper installation or removal of bearings, especially hammering the bearing on the shaft with
            off-center blows, can result in brinelling. Since such damage is seldom visible, it does not become known
            until after failure or complete disassembly. The correct drivers (preferably under an arbor press) and
            pullers should be used.
        </para>
        <para>Removing bearings is more difficult than installing them. In most cases, it is necessary to remove the
            bearing by pulling on the outer race, which can damage the balls or races. Therefore, it is a good idea to
            replace bearings during an overhaul, to prevent problems. However, if a bearing is not going to be replaced,
            avoid removal during low mileage rebuilds.
