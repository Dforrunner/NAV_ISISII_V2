        <title>REPAIR OR REPLACE WORN PARTS</title>
        <para>Many times the parts or critical adjustments causing the trouble are not replaced or corrected because the
            mechanic only inspects and replaces parts that have failed completely. All pieces should be accurately
            examined because broken parts are often just the result-not the cause-of the problem. All parts that are
            broken or worn and no longer meet specifications should be replaced.
        </para>
        <para>Also, parts that are worn to the extent that they do not have a long service life remaining should be
            replaced. Replacing these parts now will avoid another teardown on the unit in the near future. Also at this
            time, make the recommended changes or modifications to bring the transmission up to date and increase the
            service life of the unit.
