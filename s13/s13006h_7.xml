        <title>INSPECT THOROUGHLY DURING DISASSEMBLY</title>
        <para>It is poor practice to disassemble a unit or the complete transmission as quickly as possible without
            examining the parts. The mechanic may completely disassemble a unit and fail to find the cause of the
            trouble, unless he examines the parts. After the transmission is disassembled, check the lubricant for
            foreign particles. This is a source of trouble often overlooked during the disassembly.
