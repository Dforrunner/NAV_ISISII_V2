            <title>Important Procedure</title>
            <para>To locate and correct unit power or auxiliary transmission troubles, a systematic procedure should be
                followed.
            </para>
            <para>Road test whenever possible. Mechanics usually get second- or third-hand reports of trouble
                experienced with the unit. These reports do not always accurately describe the actual conditions.
                Sometimes symptoms seem to indicate trouble in the transmission, while actually the problem is with the
                axle, driveshaft, universal joints, engine or clutch. This is especially true of noise complaints.
                Therefore, before removing the transmission or related components to locate trouble, road test to check
                the possibility of trouble in other closely associated units. Road testing is most effective when the
                mechanic drives the vehicle. However, riding with the driver can be very informative.

        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Check Functioning Prior to Disassembly</title>
            <para>If a remote control is used, a careful check of the remote and connecting linkages (and their
                adjustment) must be made. The remote unit must be in good working order if the transmission is expected
                to shift satisfactorily.
            </para>
            <para>Many times, the answer to the trouble is apparent when the unit is inspected prior to disassembly. But
                this evidence is often lost when the parts are separated. If possible, check the unit prior to
                disassembly. Bear in mind that a careful inspection of the unit should be made as each disassembly step
                is performed.
            </para>

        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Inspect Thoroughly During Disassembly</title>
            <para>It is poor practice to disassemble a unit or the complete transmission as quickly as possible without
                examining the parts. The mechanic may completely disassemble a unit and fail to find the cause of the
                trouble unless he examines the parts. After the transmission is disassembled, check the lubricant for
                foreign particles. This is a source of trouble often overlooked during disassembly.
            </para>
        </svcsubproc>
        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Repair or Replace Worn Parts</title>
            <para>Many times the parts or critical adjustments causing the trouble are not replaced or corrected because
                the mechanic only inspects and replaces parts that have failed completely. All pieces should be
                carefully examined because broken parts are often just the result-not the cause-of the problem. All
                parts that are broken or worn and no longer meet specifications should be replaced.
            </para>
            <para>Also, parts that are worn to the extent that they do not have a long service life remaining should be
                replaced. Replacing these parts now will avoid another teardown on the unit in the near future. Also at
                this time, make the recommended changes or modifications to update the transmission and increase the
                service life of the unit.

            <title>Rebuild Facilities</title>
            <para>A suitable holding fixture or overhaul stand with a hole for the input shaft is desirable.</para>
            <para>For easier working conditions, table height should be 28 to 30 inches. A chain hoist should be used to
                handle the mainshaft and countershafts during removal and reassembly procedures.
            </para>
        </svcsubproc>
        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Cleanliness</title>
            <para>Transmissions should be steam cleaned prior to disassembly. Seal all openings before steam cleaning to
                prevent entry of dirt and water, which can damage serviceable parts.
            </para>
            <para>Dirt is abrasive and will cause premature wear of bearings and other parts. Spicer suggests that
                mechanics have a wash tank available to clean parts just prior to reassembly.

            <title>End Yokes and Flanges</title>
            <specpara>
                <caution>
                    <para>Do not hammer on end yokes and flanges to remove or install them. It is not only destructive
                        to the yoke or the flange itself but can also cause serious internal transmission damage.
                        Hammering destroys or mutilates the pilot diameters and warps or bends the flange. Hammering on
                        end yokes will close in the bearing bores or misalign yoke lugs. This will result in early
                        failures of journal needle bearings.
                    </para>
                </caution>
            </specpara>
            <para>Serious damage can be done internally to bearings, thrust faces and washers by hammering on external
                parts. In most designs, when the yoke/flange locknuts are tightened and secure, the internal bearings
                and gears are in proper location. When the yoke/flange is driven on the shaft, however, two conditions
                can exist:

                <item>
                    <para>If the bearing fit is tight on the shaft, usually the bearings will brinell as they must
                        absorb the pounding force.

                </item>
                <item>
                    <para>If the bearing fit is loose, the shaft will keep moving inward until it is stopped by the
                        internal parts, such as the pilot bearing thrust washers.

            <title>Bearings</title>
            <para>When a transmission is removed at relatively low mileage, bearings should be removed with pullers
                designed for this purpose. Wrap the bearings to keep out dirt. Clean, inspect and lubricate all bearings
                just prior to reassembly. If accumulated mileage is over 150,000 miles (240,000 km), we suggest that all
                bearings be replaced. If bearings are worn or damaged, always replace them regardless of mileage.

                <caution>
                    <para>When installing the front bearing retainer and seal in the transmission, use the red plastic
                        sleeve to prevent serious damage to the oil seal. Failure to use the seal sleeve will void the
                        seal warranty.
