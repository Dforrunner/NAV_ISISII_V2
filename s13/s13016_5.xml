        <title>ROAD TEST</title>
        <para>To locate and correct unit power or auxiliary transmission troubles, a systematic procedure should be
            followed.
        </para>
        <para>Road test whenever possible. Mechanics usually get second or third-hand reports of trouble experienced
            with the unit. These reports do not always accurately describe the actual conditions. Sometimes symptoms
            seem to indicate trouble in the transmission, while actually the problem is with the axle, driveshaft,
            universal joints, engine or clutch. This is especially true of noise complaints. Therefore, before removing
            the transmission or related components to locate trouble, road test to check the possibility of trouble in
            other closely associated units.
        </para>
        <para>Road testing is most effective when the mechanic drives the vehicle. However, riding with the driver can
            be very informative.
