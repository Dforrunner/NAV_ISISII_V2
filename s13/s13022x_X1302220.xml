        <title>REMOVING AND REPLACING SHIFT SOLENOIDS</title>
        <para>This procedure is used when the coil of the solenoid has been confirmed defective. Perform this procedure
            for the Neutral Shift Solenoid, as well as the 9th and 10th Gear Shift Solenoids because they are nearly
            identical valves.
        </para>
        <step1>
            <para count="1">Remove the 1/4 inch OD nylon tubing from the top exhaust port of the shift valve. Use two
                wrenches to remove the fitting from the valve exhaust port.

                valve. After the valve is removed, remove the O-rings from the bottom of the valve manifold.

            <para count="1">Clean any residual O-ring lubricant and remove all foreign matter from the manifold. New
