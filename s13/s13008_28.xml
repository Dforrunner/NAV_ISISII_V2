        <title>PROPER OIL LEVEL</title>
        <para>Make sure oil is level with filler opening. Because you can reach oil with your finger does not mean oil
            is at proper level. One inch of oil level is about one gallon of oil.

        <para>
            <emph type="bold">Proper Lubrication Levels as Related to Transmission Installation Angles</emph>
        </para>
        <para>If the transmission operating angle is more than 12 degrees, improper lubrication can occur. The operating
            angle is the transmission mounting angle in the chassis plus percent of upgrade (expressed in degrees).
        </para>
        <para>Anytime the transmission operating angle of 12 degrees is exceeded for an extended period of time, the
            transmission should be equipped with an oil pump or cooler kit to insure proper lubrication.
