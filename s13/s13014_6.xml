        <title>IMPORTANT PROCEDURE</title>
        <svcprocinfo>
            <para>When locating and correcting unit power or auxiliary transmission troubles, a systematic procedure
                should be followed.
            </para>

                whenever possible. Mechanics usually get second or third hand reports of trouble experienced with the
                unit and these reports do not always accurately describe the actual conditions. Sometimes symptoms seem
                to indicate trouble in the transmission; while actually the trouble may be caused by the axle, propeller
                shaft, universal joint, engine or clutch. This is especially true of complaints on noise. Therefore,
                before removing transmission or related components to locate trouble, always road test to check the
                possibility that trouble may exist in other closely associated units. If the mechanic can drive, road
                testing will be more effective; however, just riding with the driver can be very informative.

            <title>Check Functioning Prior to Disassembly</title>
            <para>If remote controls are used, a careful check of the remote and connecting linkage to the transmission
                must be made. The remote unit must be in good working order if the transmission is expected to shift
                satisfactorily.
            </para>
            <para>Many times the answer to the trouble is apparent when the unit is inspected prior to disassembly, but
                this evidence is often lost when the parts are separated. If possible, check the unit prior to
                disassembly. Bear in mind that a careful inspection of the unit should be made as each disassembly step
                is performed.

            <title>Inspect Thoroughly During Disassembly</title>
            <para>It is poor practice to disassemble a unit or complete transmission as quickly as possible without
                bothering to examine the parts as they come down. It happens many times that a mechanic has completely
                disassembled a unit and failed to find the cause of the trouble because he did not bother to examine the
                parts as they came apart. After the transmission is disassembled, check the lubricant for foreign
                particles which often reveal sources of trouble that are overlooked during the disassembly.

        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Repair or Replace Worn Parts</title>
            <para>Many times the parts or critical adjustments that have caused the trouble are not replaced or
                corrected because the mechanic will only inspect and replace parts that have failed completely. All
                pieces should be accurately examined because the broken parts are often just the result and not the
                cause of the trouble. All parts that are broken or worn and no longer meet specifications should be
                replaced. On large units, like a transmission, it is suggested that a mechanic replace parts that are
                worn to the extent that they do not have a long service life remaining. This avoids another teardown on
                the unit in the near future. It is also good practice, at this time, to make the changes or
                modifications recommended to bring the transmission up to date and increase the service life of the
                unit.
