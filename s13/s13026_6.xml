        <title>REASSEMBLY</title>
        <para>Make sure that interiors of case and housings are clean. It is important that dirt and other foreign
            materials be kept out of the transmission during reassembly. Dirt is an abrasive and can damage polished
            surfaces of bearings and washers. Use certain precautions, as listed below, during reassembly.
        </para>
        <step1>
            <para count="1">GASKETS-Use new gaskets throughout the transmission as it is being rebuilt. Make sure all
                gaskets are installed. An omission of any gasket can result in oil leakage or misalignment of bearing
                covers.
            </para>
        </step1>
        <step1>
            <para count="1">BOLTS-To prevent oil leakage, use Loctite 262 thread sealant on all bolts. For torque
                ratings, refer to the

            </para>
        </step1>
        <step1>
            <para count="1">SHIMS-Apply a light coat of Loctite 510 to both sides of shims before final installation to
                prevent leakage.
            </para>
        </step1>
        <step1>
            <para count="1">O-RINGS-Lubricate all O-rings with silicon lubricant.</para>
        </step1>
        <step1>
            <para count="1">INITIAL LUBRICATION-Coat all thrust washers, synchronizers, and bearings with transmission
                lubricant during reassembly to prevent damage during initial start up.
            </para>
        </step1>
        <step1>
            <para count="1">AXIAL CLEARANCES-Maintain recommended axial clearances for mainshaft gears.</para>
        </step1>
        <step1>
            <para count="1">BEARINGS-Use of a sleeve type driver that contacts the inner race of the bearing is
                recommended to prevent damage to the rollers and cage while maintaining correct bearing alignment with
                the shaft.
            </para>
        </step1>
        <para>UNIVERSAL JOINT COMPANION FLANGE OR YOKE-Pull the companion flange or yoke tightly into place with the
            output shaft nut, using 300 to 350 ft-lbs. (407 to 475 N&#8226; m) of torque. Make sure the speedometer
            drive gear or a replacement spacer has been installed. Failure to properly tighten the nut can result in
            damage to the mainshaft rear bearing.
