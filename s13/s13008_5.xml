        <title>REASSEMBLY</title>
        <para>Make sure that interiors of case and housings are clean. It is important that dirt and other foreign
            materials be kept out of the transmission during reassembly. Dirt is an abrasive and can damage polished
            surfaces of bearings and washers. Use certain precautions, as listed below, during reassembly.
        </para>
        <step1>
            <para count="1">GASKETS-Use new gaskets throughout the transmission as it is being rebuilt. Make sure all
                gaskets are installed. An omission of any gasket can result in oil leakage or misalignment of bearing
                covers. Install PTO and shifter housing gaskets dry.
            </para>
        </step1>
        <step1>
            <para count="1">BOLTS-To prevent oil leakage, use Loctite 262 thread sealant on all bolts. For torque
                ratings, refer to the
                <hotlnk document="s13008_32.xml" xrefid="t1300802">TORQUE CHART</hotlnk>.
            </para>
        </step1>
        <step1>
            <para count="1">SHIMS-Apply a light coat of Loctite 510 to both sides of shims before final installation to
                prevent leakage.
            </para>
        </step1>
        <step1>
            <para count="1">ASSEMBLY-Refer to the illustrations provided in the detailed disassembly instructions as a
                guide to reassembly.
            </para>
        </step1>
        <step1>
            <para count="1">INITIAL LUBRICATION-Coat all thrust washers, synchronizers, and bearings with transmission
                lubricant during reassembly to prevent damage during initial start up.
            </para>
        </step1>
        <step1>
            <para count="1">END PLAY-Maintain .006" to .010" end play on countershaft and mainshaft assemblies.</para>
        </step1>
        <step1>
            <para count="1">BEARINGS-Use of a sleeve type driver that contacts the inner race of the bearing is
                recommended to prevent damage to the rollers and cage.
            </para>
        </step1>
        <step1>
            <para count="1">UNIVERSAL JOINT COMPANION FLANGE OR YOKE-Pull the companion flange or yoke tightly into
                place with the output shaft nut, using 300 to 350 ft-lbs. (407 to 474 N &#183; m) of torque. Make sure
                the speedometer drive gear or a replacement spacer has been installed. Failure to properly tighten the
                nut can result in damage to the mainshaft rear bearing.
