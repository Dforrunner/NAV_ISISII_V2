            <para>It is assumed in the detailed disassembly instructions that the lubricant has been drained from the
                transmission, the necessary linkage and air lines disconnected and the transmission has been removed
                from vehicle chassis. Removal of the gear shift lever housing assembly (or remote control assembly) is
                included in the detailed instructions

                this assembly MUST be detached from shifter housing before the transmission can be removed.

                    This procedure will simplify reassembly and reduce the possibility of losing parts.

                    always good practice to clean the outside of the unit before starting the planned disassembly.

                    driven after it stops solidly. The use of soft hammers, bars and mauls for all disassembly work is
                    recommended.
