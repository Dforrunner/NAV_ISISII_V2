        <title>INSPECTION</title>
        <svcprocinfo>
            <para>Before reassembling the transmission, check each part carefully for abnormal or excessive wear and
                damage to determine reuse or replacement. When replacement is necessary, use only genuine Fuller
                Transmission parts to assure continued performance and extended life from your unit.
            </para>
            <para>Since the cost of a new part is generally a small fraction of the total cost of downtime and labor,
                avoid reusing a questionable part which could lead to additional repairs and expense soon after initial
                reassembly. To aid in determining the reuse or replacement of any transmission part, consideration
                should also be given to the unit's history, mileage, application, etc.
            </para>
            <para>Recommended inspection procedures are provided in the following checklist.</para>

            <title>BEARINGS</title>
            <step1>
                <para count="1">Wash all bearings in clean solvent. Check balls, rollers and raceways for pitting,
                    discoloration, and spalled areas. Replace bearings that are pitted, discolored, or spalled.
                </para>
            </step1>
            <step1>
                <para count="1">Lubricate bearings that are not pitted, discolored, or spalled and check for axial and
                    radial clearances.
                </para>
            </step1>
            <step1>
                <para count="1">Replace bearings with excessive clearances.</para>
            </step1>
            <step1>
                <para count="1">Check bearing fits. Bearing inner races should be tight to shaft; outer races slightly
                    tight to slightly loose in case bore. If the bearing spins freely in bore, however, case should be
                    replaced.
                </para>
            </step1>
        </svcsubproc>
        <svcsubproc>
            <title>GEARS</title>
            <step1>
                <para count="1">Check gear teeth for frosting and pitting. Frosting of gear tooth faces presents no
                    threat of transmission failure. Often in continued operation of the unit, frosted gears will "heal"
                    and not progress to the pitting stage. And in most cases, gears with light to moderate pitted teeth
                    have considerable gear life remaining and can be reused. But gears with advanced stage pitting
                    should be replaced.
                </para>
            </step1>
            <step1>
                <para count="1">Check for gears with clutching teeth abnormally worn, tapered, or reduced in length from
                    clashing in shifting. Replace gears found in any of these conditions.
                </para>
            </step1>
            <step1>
                <para count="1">Check axial clearance of gears. Where excessive clearance is found, check gear snap
                    ring, washer, spacer, and gear hub for excessive wear. Maintain .005" to .012" axial clearance
                    between mainshaft gears.
                </para>

        <svcsubproc>
            <title>SPLINES</title>
            <para>Check splines on all shafts for abnormal wear. If sliding clutch gears, companion flange, or clutch
                hub have worn into the sides of the splines, replace the specific shaft affected.
            </para>

        <svcsubproc>
            <title>TOLERANCE/LIMIT WASHERS</title>
            <para>Check surfaces of all washers. Washers scored or reduced in thickness should be replaced.</para>

        <svcsubproc>
            <title>GRAY IRON PARTS</title>
            <para>Check all gray iron parts for cracks and breaks. Replace or repair parts found to be damaged. Heavy
                castings may be welded or brazed provided the cracks do not extend into bearing bores or bolting
                surfaces. When welding, however, never place the ground so as to allow current to pass through the
                transmission.
