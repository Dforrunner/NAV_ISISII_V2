        <title>OPERATING TEMPERATURES</title>
        <para>The transmission should not be operated consistently at temperatures above 250 degrees F (120 degrees C).
            However, intermittent operating temperatures to 300 degrees F (149 degrees C) will not harm the
            transmission. Operating temperatures above 250 degrees F increase the lubricant's rate of oxidation and
            shorten its effective life. When the average operating temperature is above 250 degrees F, the transmission
            may require more frequent oil changes or external cooling.
        </para>
        <para>The following conditions in any combination can cause operating temperatures of over 250 degrees F: (1)
            operating consistently at slow speeds, (2) high ambient temperatures, (3) restricted air flow around
            transmission, (4) exhaust system too close to transmission, (5) high horsepower, overdrive operation.
        </para>
        <para>External oil coolers are available to reduce operating temperatures when the above conditions are
            encountered.

        <para>Transmission Oil Coolers are:</para>
