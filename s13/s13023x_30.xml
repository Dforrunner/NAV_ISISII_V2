            <para>Noise is usually very elusive and generally not the fault of the transmission; therefore, mechanics
                should road test to determine if the driver's complaint of noise is actually in the transmission.
            </para>
            <para>In numerous instances, drivers have insisted that the noise was in the transmission, however,
                investigations revealed the noise to be caused by one of the following conditions:

            <para>Mechanics should try to locate and eliminate noise by means other than transmission removal, or
                overhaul. However, if the noise appears to be in the transmission, try to break it down into the
                following classifications. If possible, determine what position the gear shift lever is in when the
                noise occurs. If the noise is evident in only one gear position, the cause of the noise is generally
                traceable to the gears in operation.

                <title>Growl and humming or, more serious, a grinding noise.</title>
            </para>
            <para>These noises are caused by worn, chipped, rough or cracked gears. As gears continue to wear, the
                grinding noise will be noticeable, particularly in the gear position that throws the greatest load on
                the worn gear.
            </para>
            <para>
                <title>Hissing or, more serious, a thumping or bumping-type noise.</title>
            </para>
            <para>Hissing noises can be caused by bad bearings. As bearings wear and retainers start to break up, etc.,
                the noise could change to a thumping or bumping.

            <para>
                <title>Metallic rattles within the transmission usually result from a variety of conditions.</title>
            </para>
            <para>Engine torsional vibrations are transmitted to the transmission through the clutch. In heavy duty
                equipment, clutch discs with vibration dampers are not used, so a rattle, particularly in neutral, is
                common with diesel equipment. In general, engine speeds should be 600 RPM or above to eliminate
                objectionable rattles and vibration during the idle. A defective or faulty injector would cause a rough
                or lower idle speed and a rattle in the transmission. Rattle could also be caused by excessive backlash
                in PTO unit mounting.
