        <title>Service Procedure</title>
        <step1>
            <para count="1">Clutch Housing Mounting. Check clutch housing bolts for looseness.</para>
        </step1>
        <step1>
            <para count="1">Clutch Release Bearing (Not Shown). Remove hand hole cover and check the radial and axial
                clearance of the release bearing. Check relative position of thrust surface of release bearing with
                thrust sleeve on push-type clutches.
            </para>
        </step1>
        <step1>
            <para count="1">Clutch Pedal Shaft and Bores. Pry upward on shafts to check wear. If excessive movement is
                found, remove the clutch release mechanism and check bushings in bores and wear on shafts.
            </para>
        </step1>
        <step1>
            <para count="1">Lubricant. Change at specified service intervals. Use only the types and grades as
                recommended in GROUP 10 - LUBRICATION in the CTS-5000 Master Service Manual.
            </para>
        </step1>
        <step1>
            <para count="1">Fill and Drain Plugs. Remove fill plugs and check level of lubricant at specified intervals.
                Tighten fill and drain plugs securely.
            </para>
        </step1>
        <step1>
            <para count="1">Bolts and Gaskets. Check all bolts, especially those on PTO covers and rear bearing covers
                for looseness which would cause oil leakage. Refer to the
                <hotlnk document="s13025_X1302501.xml" xrefid="x1302501">TORQUE CHART</hotlnk>. Check PTO opening and
                rear bearing covers for oil leakage due to faulty gasket.
            </para>
        </step1>
        <step1>
            <para count="1">Gear Shift Lever. Check for looseness and free play in housing. If lever is loose in
                housing, proceed to Step 8.
            </para>
        </step1>
        <step1>
            <para count="1">Gear Shift Lever Housing Assembly. Remove the gear shift lever housing assembly from the
                transmission. Check tension spring and washer for set and wear. Check the gear shift lever spade pin and
                spade in slot for wear. Check bottom end of gear shift lever for wear, and check slot of yokes and
                blocks in the shifter housing for wear at contact points with shift lever.

            <para count="1">Universal Joint Companion Flange or Yoke Nut. Check for tightness. Tighten to recommended
                torque. Refer to the
                <hotlnk document="s13025_X1302501.xml" xrefid="x1302501">TORQUE CHART</hotlnk>

        </step1>
        <step1>
            <para count="1">Output Shaft (Not Shown). Pry upward against the output shaft to check radial clearance in
                the mainshaft rear bearing.
            </para>
        </step1>
        <specpara>
