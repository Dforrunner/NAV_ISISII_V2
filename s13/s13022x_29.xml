        <title>OIL CHANGES</title>
        <para>Spicer recommends an initial oil change and flush after the transmission is placed in actual service. At
            the time of first engine oil change, the transmission should also be serviced. In off-highway use, the
            change should be made after 24 hours-but before 100 hours-of service have been completed.
        </para>
        <para>Many factors influence oil change periods. Therefore, a definite mileage interval is not specified here.
            In general, a drain and flush should be scheduled at 50,000 miles with heavy duty SAE engine oil, or at
            250,000 miles with synthetic engine oil for normal over-the-highway operations. Off-highway uses usually
            require an oil change every 1,000 hours. The oil level in the transmission should be checked every 5,000
            miles on-highway, or every 40 hours in off-highway operation. When it is necessary to add oil, Spicer
            recommends that types and brands of oil not be mixed. The correct oil level in this transmission is
            established by the filler plug opening.
