        <title>OIL CHANGES</title>
        <para>We recommend an initial oil change and flush after the transmission is placed in actual service. At the
            time of first engine oil change, the transmission should also be made after 24 hours - but before 100 hours
            - of service have been completed.
        </para>
        <para>Many factors influence the following oil change periods. Therefore, a definite mileage interval is not
            specified here. In general, a drain and flush should be scheduled at the closest engine oil change to 50,000
            miles with heavy duty SAE engine oil, or at 250,000 miles with synthetic CD SAE 50 engine oil, for normal
            over-the-highway operations.
        </para>
        <para>Off highway uses usually require an oil change every 1000 hours. The oil level in the transmission should
            be checked every 5000 miles (8045 km) on-highway, or every 40 hours in off-highway operation. When it is
            necessary to add oil, we recommend that types of brands of oil not be mixed. The correct oil level in this
            transmission is established by the filler plug opening.
