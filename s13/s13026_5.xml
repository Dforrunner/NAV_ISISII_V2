        <title>INSPECTION</title>
        <para>Before reassembling the transmission, check each part carefully for abnormal or excessive wear and damage
            to determine reuse or replacement. When replacement is necessary, use only genuine Fuller Trans- mission
            parts to assure continued performance and extended life from your unit.
        </para>
        <para>Since the cost of a new part is generally a small fraction of the total cost of downtime and labor, avoid
            reusing a questionable part which could lead to additional repairs and expense soon after initial
            reassembly. To aid in determining the reuse or replacement of any transmission part, consideration should
            also be given to the unit's history, mileage, application, etc.
        </para>
        <para>Recommended inspection procedures are provided in the following checklist.</para>
        <step1>
            <para count="1">BEARINGS</para>
            <step2>
                <para count="1">Wash all bearings in clean solvent. Check balls, rollers and raceways for pitting,
                    discoloration, and spalled areas. Replace bearings that are pitted, discolored, spalled, or damaged
                    during disassembly.
                </para>
            </step2>
            <step2>
                <para count="1">Lubricate bearings that are not pitted, discolored, or spalled and check for axial and
                    radial clearances.
                </para>
            </step2>
            <step2>
                <para count="1">Replace bearings with excessive clearances.</para>
            </step2>
            <step2>
                <para count="1">Check bearing fit. Bearing inner races should be tight to shaft; outer races slightly
                    tight to slightly loose in case bore. If the bearing spins freely in bore, however, case should be
                    replaced.
                </para>
            </step2>
        </step1>
        <step1>
            <para count="1">GEARS</para>
            <step2>
                <para count="1">Check gear teeth for frosting and pitting. Frosting of gear tooth faces presents no
                    threat of transmission failure. Often in continued operation of the unit, frosted gears will "heal"
                    and not progress to the pitting stage. And in most cases, gears with light to moderate pitted teeth
                    have considerable gear life remaining and can be reused. But gears with advanced stage pitting
                    should be replaced.
                </para>
            </step2>
            <step2>
                <para count="1">Check for gears with clutching teeth abnormally worn, tapered, or reduced in length from
                    clashing in shifting. Replace gears found in any of these conditions.
                </para>
            </step2>
            <step2>
                <para count="1">Check axial clearance of gears. Where excessive clearance is found, check gear snap
                    ring, washer, spacer, and gear hub for excessive wear.

            <step2>
                <para count="1">Check splines on all shafts for abnormal wear. If sliding clutches, gears, companion
                    flange, or clutch hub has worn into the sides of the splines, replace the specific shaft affected.
