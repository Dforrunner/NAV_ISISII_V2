            <title>Inspect Thoroughly During Disassembly</title>
            <para>It is poor practice to disassemble a unit or the complete transmission without examining the parts.
                The mechanic may completely disassemble a unit and fail to find the cause of the trouble unless he
                examines the parts. After the transmission is disassembled, check the lubricant for foreign particles.
                This is a source of trouble often overlooked during the disassembly.

            <para>A suitable holding fixture or overhaul stand with a hole for the input shaft is desirable.</para>
            <para>For easier working conditions, table height should be 28 to 30 inches. A light chain hoist should be
                used to handle the mainshaft and countershafts during removal and reassembly procedures.

            <title>Cleanliness</title>
            <para>Transmissions should be steam cleaned prior to disassembly. Seal all openings before steam cleaning to
                prevent entry of dirt and water which can damage serviceable parts.
            </para>
            <para>Dirt is abrasive and will cause premature wear of bearings and other parts. We suggest that mechanics
                have a small wash tank to clean parts just prior to reassembly.
            </para>

        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Bearings</title>
            <para>When a transmission is removed at relatively low mileage, bearings should be removed with pullers
                designed for this purpose. Wrap the bearings to keep out dirt. Clean, inspect and lubricate all bearings
                just prior to reassembly. Refer to GROUP 10 - LUBRICATION in the CTS-5000 Master Service Manual. If
                accumulated mileage is over 150,000 miles, we suggest that all bearings be replaced.
