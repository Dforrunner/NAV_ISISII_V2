        <title>OIL CHANGES</title>
        <para>We recommend an initial oil change and flush after the transmission is placed in
            <emph type="bold">actual</emph>
            service. This change should be made any time following 3000 miles (4827 km), but
            <emph type="bold">never exceed 5000 miles</emph>
            (8045 km), of over-the-road service. In off-highway use, the change should be made after 24 and before 100
            hours of service have elapsed. There are many factors that influence the following oil change periods and we
            have not specified a definite mileage interval.
        </para>
        <para>In general, it is suggested that a drain and flush period be scheduled every 50,000 miles (80,450 km) for
            normal over-the- highway operations. Off-highway usually requires an oil change every 1000 hours. The oil
            level in the transmission should be checked every 5,000 miles (8,045 km) on-highway, or every 40 hours in
            off-highway operation. When it is necessary to add oil, we recommend that types or brands of oil should not
            be mixed. The correct oil level in
            <emph type="bold">all</emph>
            Spicer transmissions is established by the filler plug opening.
