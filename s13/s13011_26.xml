            <title>TROUBLESHOOTING PROCEDURE</title>
            <para>To locate and correct unit power or auxiliary transmission troubles, a systematic procedure should be
                followed.
            </para>
            <para>Road test whenever possible. Mechanics usually get second or third hand reports of trouble experienced
                with the unit. These reports do not always accurately describe the actual conditions. Sometimes symptoms
                seem to indicate trouble in the transmission, while actually the problem is with the axle, driveshaft,
                universal joints, engine or clutch. This is especially true of noise complaints. Therefore, before
                removing the transmission or related components to locate trouble, road test to check the possibility of
                trouble in other closely associated units. Road testing is most effective when the mechanic drives the
                vehicle. However, riding with the driver can be very helpful.
