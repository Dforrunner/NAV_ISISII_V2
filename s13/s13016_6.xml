        <title>CHECK REMOTE CONTROL</title>
        <para>If a remote control is used, a careful check of the remote and connecting linkages (and their adjustment)
            must be made. The remote unit must be in good working order if the transmission is expected to shift
            satisfactorily.
        </para>
        <para>Many times, the answer to the trouble is apparent when the unit is inspected prior to disassembly. But
            this evidence is often lost when the parts are separated. If possible, check the unit prior to disassembly.
            Bear in mind that a careful inspection of the unit should be made as each disassembly step is performed.
