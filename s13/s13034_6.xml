        <title>GENERAL PRECAUTIONS FOR ASSEMBLY</title>
        <step1>
            <para count="1">GASKETS: Use new gaskets and seals throughout when reassembling.</para>
        </step1>
        <step1>
            <para count="1">BOLTS: Make sure all bolts are set to the recommended torques.</para>
        </step1>
        <step1>
            <para count="1">LUBRICATION: Coat seals, O-rings, and splines with lubricant. This provides an initial
                lubrication and helps to prevent damage during assembly. Refer to GROUP 10 - LUBRICATION in the CTS-5000
                Master Service Manual for specifications and fill levels.
            </para>
        </step1>
        <step1>
            <para count="1">BEARINGS: Bearing drivers are recommended for installation of bearings. Equal forces are
                applied to both races of bearing which maintain correct bearing alignment with bore and shaft. If
                another type of driver is used, it is important that the force be applied to either the inner race or
                the outer race without pushing through the balls.
            </para>
        </step1>
        <step1>
            <para count="1">YOKES AND FLANGES: Apply grease or lubricant to yoke seal land before pushing through shaft
                seals. Pull end yoke or companion flange in place with locknut and tighten yoke/flange nut to 542 to 610
                Nm (400 to 450 ft-lbs). Failure to draw down tightly can result in axial movement of the shaft and
                damage to the bearings. Check to make sure that slinger on yoke or flange does not hit transfer case
                housing.
            </para>
        </step1>
        <step1>
            <para count="1">GEARS AND SHAFTS: Check gear teeth surfaces and edges for nicks or burrs which can result in
                noisy operation. If nicks are found, use a stone to level area around nicks flush with the gear surface.
                Check shaft splines for burrs which can result in hard shifting or difficult assembly.
            </para>
        </step1>
        <step1>
            <para count="1">DISCONNECT OPERATION:</para>
            <step2>
                <para count="1">Air pressure (80 to 120 psi) is needed to shift the air shift disconnect in and out of
                    engagement. Check disconnect operation after installing the air lines and cab control.
                </para>
            </step2>
            <step2>
                <para count="1">While installing linkage or cable to the manual shift clevis, care should be taken not
                    to loosen the clevis from the shifter shaft.
                </para>
            </step2>
            <step2>
                <para count="1">Both the manual and air shift disconnect have an indicator light switch provision which
                    when connected to the battery, a light in the cab will illuminate when disconnect is engaged.
