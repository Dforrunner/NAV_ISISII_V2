            <geninfo>
                <para>Trucks built after the above referenced date have two wire fuel transfer pumps that rely entirely
                    on the ESC for their activation. The dual tank with transfer pump feature on HPV vehicles is
                    designed to transfer fuel from the storage tank to the draw tank under strict guidelines and fuel
                    level conditions. The ESC reads the fuel levels in both tanks and "filters" these readings to
                    account for sloshing fuel and to assure that the draw tank is not overfilled and the supply tank is
                    not emptied. The information provided in this TSI is provided to help the technician understand and
                    answer two basic questions: Does the transfer pump move fuel from the supply tank into the draw
                    tank, and if not, what is the proper area to troubleshoot?

            <title>Procedure</title>
            <svcprocinfo>
                <para>As previously mentioned the ESC controls the fuel transfer pump and uses very complicated rules
                    and conditions to determine whether or not to turn on the transfer pump. Some of the more basic
                    conditions that must be met before the pump is energized are:
                </para>
                <seqlist style="arabic">
                    <item>
                        <para>No faults (open or shorted) can be active on either of the fuel sensors.</para>
                    </item>
                    <item>
                        <para>ESC must see engine RPM.</para>
                    </item>
                    <item>
                        <para>Supply tank must be at or above the 20% level.</para>

                    <item>
                        <para>Draw tank fuel level must be at 12% (+/- 6%) below the supply tank fuel level.</para>
                    </item>
                </seqlist>
                <para>Because there are various conditions when the tanks are very full or very empty, the above
                    parameters can vary. This procedure is written to provide the technician with a standard test
                    procedure to be followed in verifying the capability of the fuel transfer system. Passing these
                    tests assures that the system performs as designed and will provide the customer with a system that
                    equalizes the fuel levels of the vehicle's two tanks while providing a system without the
                    vulnerability of a fuel crossover line.

                        <para>Do not perform the following test procedures if the draw tank (fuel sensor 1) has a fuel

                            spilling fuel, and causing a hazardous waste spill or a fire hazard.

                            without fuel and causing damage to the pump.
