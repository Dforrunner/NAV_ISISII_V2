                <para>It is normal for oil residue to be present in the intake air pipes on engines that are equipped
                    simultaneously with both an Diamond Logic&#8482; Engine Brake and an EVRT&#174; Electronically
                    Controlled Turbocharger.
                </para>
                <para>This oil residue is a result of the exhaust back pressure produced when the exhaust brake is
                    applied. This oil residue is normal and no service of the turbocharger or the engine is required.
