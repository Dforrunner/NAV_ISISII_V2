                <para>A new Wear Sleeve / Removal Tool (ZTSE4889) has been released. This tool is used to remove the old
                    wear sleeve from the crankshaft flange.

                            new Wear Sleeve / Removal Tool. The new tool is easier to use than the Wear Sleeve / Removal
                            tool specified in the EGES 345 Engine Service Manual.
