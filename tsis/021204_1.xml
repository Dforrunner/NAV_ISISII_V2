                <para>A new long-life remote-mounted 3-way air solenoid valve is available for use with engine on-off
                    fans and radiator shutters. It is designed to be mounted to the cowl (strongly recommended), and can
                    be used to replace engine-mounted solenoids. This kit is designed for International vehicles and
                    includes the solenoid valve as well as harnesses, tubing adapters, fittings, tubing, tie straps and
                    instructions. The 3-way designation means that it can be used in both normally closed and normally
                    open applications.
