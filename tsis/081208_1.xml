                <para>A printing error has been found in the International&#174; MaxxForce&#8482; 7 Engine Operation and
                    Maintenance Manual, 1171941R1. The manual incorrectly indicates a prescreen element is located on
                    the fuel pump and should be serviced at 32,000 km (20,000 miles), 12 months, 700 hours or 7570
                    liters (2000 gallons) of fuel.
                </para>
                <para>All International&#174; MaxxForce&#8482; 7 diesel engines were manufactured without a prescreen
                    element. The prescreen bowl should never be removed from the pump; since it has no screen to
                    service.
                </para>
                <para>The Engine Operation and Maintenance Manual is being updated to an 1171941R2 version to correct
                    this error. All service information regarding the fuel prescreen element has been eliminated from
                    the manual. An electronic version of 1171941R2 can be found on ISIS. An updated printed manual will
                    be available soon.
