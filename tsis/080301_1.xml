                <para>In an effort to standardize service parts, International is no longer servicing the IROS
                    suspension spring hanger p/n 3545280C1. Instead, a kit p/n 2591842C92 is available as a replacement.

            <para>The 2591842C92 kit contains two spring hanger brackets, one three piece crossmember, and required
                fastener hardware. Both new hangers must be installed along with the crossmember on a 4x2 truck. In the
                case of a 6x4, it is acceptable to only replace the brackets and crossmember on one of the drive axles
                providing the other axle has no bracket or mounting problem. The holes in the frame rail for mounting
                the spring hanger will need to be enlarged to accept the new 20mm fasteners. A 20mm ream should be used
                to enlarge the holes. The new holes should be just large enough that the new fasteners will barely fit
                through them. The 20mm fasteners should be torqued to 425 - 460 ft. lbs. The 16mm fasteners should be
                torqued to 200- 240 ft. lbs.
