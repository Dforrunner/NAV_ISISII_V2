                <para>This TSI applies to model years 1999 through 2003 for the T 444E engine.</para>
                <para>A condition can occur with oil leaking from the high-pressure pump area. These leaks usually occur
                    when the plug or fittings loosen over time.
                </para>
                <para>A service kit is available to correct leaks at the high-pressure hose fittings or the port plug.
                    If a leak occurs at the check valve or ferry plug, the high-pressure pump must be replaced.
                </para>
                <para>This kit is for the T444E engine and is intended for on-vehicle repair only. The service kit
                    contains three O-rings, a capsule of Loctite&#174; 680 Sealant and an installation instruction sheet
                    describing the procedure to stop the leaks.
                </para>
                <para>The service kit is available by ordering part number 1843716C91 from your International&#174;
                    dealer or Service Parts supplier.
                </para>
                <para>The leak may be coming from the pump fittings where the high-pressure lines are attached and/or
                    the port plug located at the rear of the oil passage (see Figure 1).
