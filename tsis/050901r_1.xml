                    the reinforcement ribs (see Figure 1), then the fender extension can be cut to receive a mud flap
                    assembly outlined in this publication. Go to Step 2. Otherwise, cracks extending higher than a
                    maximum of 2.5 inches vertically above the bottom of the fender extension's ribs and/or visible
                    anywhere else on the fender extension cannot be fixed with the process outlined in this publication.
