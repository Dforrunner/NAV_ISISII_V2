                <para>When diagnosing a Horton HTS or Horton DriveMaster fan drive it is important to use the following
                    Troubleshooting Guides to properly diagnose the failure. It is important to understand the root
                    cause of the failure to insure that the same failure does not reoccur on the replacement fan drive.
