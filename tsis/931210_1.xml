                <para>Complaints have been received about a "knocking" or "ticking" noise coming from the front of the
                    Cummins N14 engines equipped with a Horton on/off fan clutch. The noise is detected only when the
                    vehicle is not moving, engine is running at low idle speed and the fan clutch is not engaged. Only a
                    very small fraction of the total population has reported this phenomenon.
                </para>
                <para>Descriptions of this "noise" vary and often it cannot be recognized by second parties.</para>
                <para>We believe the cause is the fan clutch/fan reacting to an engine vibration that is in the natural
                    frequency range of the fan clutch.
                </para>
                <para>Of these "noise" investigated to date, there is no reason to believe that damage to the engine or
                    fan clutch will result.
                </para>
                <para>When this noise is encountered, costly tear down, replacing parts or making other efforts to
                    repair should not be undertaken.
