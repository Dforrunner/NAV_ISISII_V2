                <para>A new shim and service kit for the camshaft position (CMP) sensor have been released. The new
                    service kit (P/N 1841521C91), consisting of two 0.25 mm (0.010 in) thick shims and two 0.13 mm
                    (0.005 in) thick shims, replaces the existing kit (P/N 1826583C91) that is used in the field.
                </para>
                <para>The new shim has a larger inside diameter [25 mm (1 in)] than the old shim. This allows for
                    installation of the shim without removing the sensor O-ring, thus making assembly easier. The
                    outside diameter was also changed to 38 mm (1.5 in). Both dimensions are a standard shim size.
                </para>
                <para>The new shim material is brass instead of steel. Changing to a non-ferrous metal prevents
                    interference with the sensor's internal magnet, also making assembly easier.
