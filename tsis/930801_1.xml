                <para>Radiators and their supports are often rubber mounted to provide extended life. This can result in
                    radiators and their supports not being electrically grounded to the vehicle chassis. If a body
                    builder or user mounts an electrical device to the radiator or support, the ground return path may
                    be through the coolant to the engine, which is grounded. Current through the coolant will cause
                    electrolytic corrosion of the radiator resulting in rapid radiator failure. The degree of
                    electrolytic corrosion varies with the type of electrical device and the length of time the device
                    is normally activated.

                    <emph type="bold">Mounting electrical devices to radiators or their supports is not
                        recommended.</emph>However, if necessary to do so, it is recommended that a 10 gauge ground
                    cable be added between any electrical device mounted to the radiator or its supports and the frame
                    or engine. Care must be taken to insure that paint or rust is removed to insure a good ground. A
                    protective grease should be applied to prevent corrosion of the electrical connection.
