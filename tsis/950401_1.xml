                    port location for use with a 3/8 inch Synflex exhaust line.

                <para>A change has been made to the Bendix MV3 parking brake control valve that will eliminate the

                    line diameter. The 3/8 inch fitting has been replaced with a tapered 1/2 inch nipple. The exhaust

            <para>Prior to installation of the new style MV3 valve part number 2014785C92 on units originally built with
                the 3/8 inch exhaust port line with "push-to-connect" fittings, a new 1/2 inch diameter, black, Synflex
                exhaust line must be installed. This new line should be 40 inches long and routed along the existing 3/8
                inch exhaust line and tie strapped to the harness every 8 inches. It
                <emph type="bold">will not</emph>
                be necessary to remove the original 3/8 inch exhaust line. Remove the end of the 3/8 inch line from the
                hole in the fire wall and replace it with the end of the new 1/2 inch line. No enlargement of the exit
                hole should be required. Press the valve end of the new exhaust line firmly over the tapered exhaust
                port nipple. Complete the installation of the new MV3 valve.
