                <para>Procedures in this TSI are intended to reduce the risk of major engine failure for engines having
                    been partially or totally submerged during a flood. Doing these procedures does not completely
                    eliminate possible engine failure.

                            Engine Corporation. Engine damage or failure, caused by flood water, is not a defect in
                            material or workmanship on the part of International; therefore, damage or failure will not
                            be covered by International.
