                <para>This TSI applies to all I6 electronic injection controlled engines with high-pressure oil pumps,
                    serial number range 933364 and above (excluding the 2,000,000 serial number series). Engines
                    equipped with an Exhaust Gas Recirculating (EGR) valve, a 2004 MY emissions label, and a serial
                    number that starts with 2,000,000 and above are excluded from use of this service kit.
                </para>
                <para>This TSI is to announce that the high-pressure oil pump service kit and instruction sheet have
                    been updated, kit part number 1842906C92. Changes are longer plugs and fitting threads that are
                    required for increased torque to prevent leaks. The 1/4 inch ferry plug check ball is now a
                    serviceable part but is not included in the kit.
                </para>
                <para>Also included in the kit instructions is a new procedure requiring a heat gun to apply heat to the
                    high-pressure pump housing bosses for removal of the outlet fitting and construction and oil ferry
                    plugs.
                </para>
                <para>Also, new torque values have been added for the following items:</para>

                            pump to be repaired, do not attempt further repair of the pump. Replacement of the pump is
                            advised.
