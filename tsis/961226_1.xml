                <para>The lube oil pick-up tube bracket is revised for rear sump applications. The bracket mounting hole
                    has been enlarged and a new fastener is released to ease installation and eliminate any misalignment
                    of the pick-up tube.
                </para>
                <para>The bracket is brazed to the tube and is not serviced separately. Part number for the tube and
                    bracket assembly is advanced to
                    <emph type="bold">1820225C93</emph>. Bracket identity can also be recognized by the mounting hole:
                    New bracket .500" through hole; Previous bracket .343 X .500" elongated through hole.
                </para>
                <para>The revised bracket requires a new hex-head mounting bolt (part number
                    <emph type="bold">1829820C1</emph>). The new bolt is furnished with a non-removable washer. Previous
                    mounting bolt (part number 1817812C1) has a hex-flange head.

                        <para>Torque the new fastener same as previous fastener: 20 N&#183;m (15 ft&#183;lbf).</para>
