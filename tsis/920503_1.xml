                <para>Sheppard "M" Series power steering gears are available on all International vehicles with
                    12,000-lb-capacity and above steer axles. The "M" Series steering input effort allows for greater
                    "road feel" while driving on the highway and was developed specifically for line haul applications.
                </para>
                <para>The "M" Series steering response allows driver control through minimal, but firm input effort. The
                    input effort required can be as high as 80 inch-pounds to 100 inch-pounds on the steering wheel.
                    This amount of input effort helps eliminate oversteer, and increases "road feel" for line haul
                    applications.
