                <para>The accumulator or receiver dryer does need to be replaced if the system refrigerant lines have
                    been open for more than 30 minutes (failed refrigerant line or hose) or if the AC system has been
                    contaminated (internal compressor failure).
                </para>
                <para>The accumulator or receiver dryer does not need to be replaced when the air conditioner (AC)
                    system has been performing properly and a condition develops requiring the replacement of a seal or
                    other component, and the AC system refrigerant lines are capped to prevent contamination from
                    entering the system.
                </para>
                <para>It is important when evacuating the AC system that an
                    <emph type="bold">electronic vacuum gauge</emph>
                    (Part Number ZTSE4620) is connected to the recovery system. The AC system is correctly evacuated
                    when the
                    <emph type="bold">electronic vacuum gauge</emph>
                    reads 750 to 1000 microns.
