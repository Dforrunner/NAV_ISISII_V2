            <title>HOW THE BUS BODY IS DESIGNED AND CONSTRUCTED</title>
            <para>An International bus body is designed as a unit, which means that every structural part is tied to
                other structural parts to form a whole. This concept is known as unit body construction. The strength
                and durability of the bus body depends on the structural integrity of the unit. If any structural part
                is damaged or removed, the entire bus body is weakened. Therefore, a damaged structural part must be
                carefully repaired or replaced exactly as it was originally so body strength can be restored. All units
                are to meet all applicable FMVSS requirements as of the date of manufacture.

            <para>The
                <emph type="bold">floor</emph>
                of the bus body is designed as the foundation upon which the rest of the body is constructed. If the
                floor is ever twisted or damaged (other than superficial or cosmetic damage) it cannot be repaired, and
                the bus must be removed from service.
