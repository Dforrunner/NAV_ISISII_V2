            <para>All glass installed in this vehicle meets FMVSS requirements. Should glass require replacing, replace
                with the same type of glass.
            </para>
            <para>The windshield is four pieces, flat, laminated AS-1, tinted 73% light transmission and sealed with a
                rubber lace and rubber gasket.
            </para>
            <para>The driver's window is AS-2 laminated safety glass encased by an aluminum frame with a center latching
                device.
            </para>
            <para>The entrance door glass is AS-2 tempered safety glass installed with rubber seal gaskets and lace
                rubber.
            </para>
            <para>The side (passenger) windows are mounted in an aluminum frame that allows up to a 9" x 24" opening.
                The top glass is adjustable. Buses with 78" headroom may allow a larger opening.
            </para>
            <para>Pushout-type windows are installed in the passenger compartment. These windows are designed to pivot
                open at the top or side as an escape opening in the event of an emergency. Pushout windows are held
                closed by a mechanical latch.
            </para>
            <para>There are many variations of window and glass arrangements installed in school bus applications.
                However, the installation and maintenance procedures given in this section can be used as general
                information that is contingent on state specifications (optional equipment).
