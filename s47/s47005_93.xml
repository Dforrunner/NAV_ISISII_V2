        <para>Emergency exit windows on the RE bus body consist of two different style assemblies, a horizontally hinged
            and a vertically hinged emergency exit window. Both sets of windows are installed from inside the bus and
            are secured by a mounting cover plate.

                <para>The push-out / kick - out windows are equipped with buzzer alarms switches. The switch wires are
                    routed from the window latch to the window header. The switches are connected to a driver warning
                    buzzer located at the driver position. Inspect the wire routing.
