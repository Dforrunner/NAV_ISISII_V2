        <title>REPORTING SAFETY DEFECTS</title>
        <para>If you believe that your vehicle has a defect that could cause an accident, injury or death, you should
            immediately inform the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), in addition to notifying
            International Truck and Engine Corporation.
        </para>
        <para>If NHTSA receives similar complaints, it may open an investigation, and if it finds that a safety defect
            exists in a group of vehicles, it may order a recall and remedy campaign. However, NHTSA cannot get involved
            in individual problems between you, your dealer or International Truck and Engine Corporation.
        </para>
        <para>To contact NHTSA, you may either call the Auto Safety Hotline toll-free at 1-800-424-9393 (or 366-0123) in
            Washington, D.C. area), or write to:
