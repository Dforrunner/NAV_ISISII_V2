                <para>Never force the fresh/recirculate air door open. If the door position must be changed, follow the
                    referenced procedures. Forcing the door will result in a broken door shaft and a costly repair.

        <para>On vehicles equipped with an HVAC inlet air filter, inspect the filter element for dust and road dirt at
            the beginning of each cooling season. Clean or replace the element as needed. More frequent cleaning and/or
            replacement may be required on vehicles operated in severe conditions. The models covered here may have
            either, or both, of the following two inlet air filters.
        </para>
        <para>A filter/grille assembly may be located at the top of the fresh air intake, above the evaporator housing.
            This filter is mounted to the air intake above the cowl drain tray. This filter assembly is secured with
            thumb screws and does not require tools for removal and installation.
        </para>
        <para>Another filter may be located inside the evaporator housing, under the fresh/recirculate air door. To
            replace this air filter refer to
