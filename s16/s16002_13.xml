        <title>FINISH MATCHING</title>
        <svcsubsecinfo>
            <para>The first thing a customer checks after a vehicle is refinished is its appearance. It is the
                appearance that generates the most complaints, so it is important that the repair is an acceptable match
                to the original finish.
            </para>
            <para>The three main factors that affect appearance are: the color of the vehicle, surface texture, and the
                overall condition of the finish.

            <title>MATCHING COLOR</title>
            <para>Color is described in three different terms: (1) Value, which describes a color's lightness or
                darkness; (2) Hue, which describes its tint or cast, i.e., a green can be more yellow or more blue; and
                (3) Chroma, which refers to a color's richness and intensity.
