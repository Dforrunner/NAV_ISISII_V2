            <title>Electric Windshield Wipers</title>
            <para>The windshield wiper motor is a permanent magnet electric motor with a worm gear on the armature shaft
                which drives a follower gear on the crankshaft. A cam is molded on the output gear and operates against
                a switch mounted on the molded cover and is connected in the motor circuit.
            </para>
            <para>When the motor is turned on, the switch floats in the circuit. When the motor is turned off, the
                switch continues to supply current to the motor until the molded cam reaches the switch. This opens the
                circuit in the motor and stops the wipers in the park position.

                <caution>
                    <para>Do not attempt to move the blades through their sweep by grasping the wiper arm. This action
                        may result in the teeth being broken off the drive gear or the linkage bent. If blades are
                        frozen to windshield, do not operate control switch until they have been freed.

            <para>The three-position switch located on a knob at the end of the turn signal lever controls off, low

                knob.
