        <title>OFF-SEASON CARE</title>
        <para>In general, any system containing automatic devices will function with less trouble if it is not permitted
            to remain idle over long periods. Therefore, the most important off-season care of the air conditioning
            system consists of periodic operation of the unit. Operating the unit for five minutes twice a month after
            engine warm-up keeps the compressor seals lubricated. If the seals dry out, they may crack and leak when the
            system is operated.
        </para>
        <para>In addition, if the system is not operated periodically, clutch and compressor bearings could become
            brinneled. This is caused by the continual hammering effect on the bearing surface in the same spot from
            normal vibration during vehicle operation.
        </para>
        <para>Do not remove compressor drive belt during the off-season, as clutch and compressor bearings may become
            brinneled.
