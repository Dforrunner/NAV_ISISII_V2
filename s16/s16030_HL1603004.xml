                <para>Safety goggles or other adequate eye protection must be worn when working with refrigerant. The
                    temperature of liquid refrigerant is -20 degrees F (-29 degrees C). Serious injury or blindness will
                    result from refrigerant contacting the eyes.

                    contact with the skin, remove any contaminated clothing, including shoes; then treat the injury as
                    though the skin had been frostbitten or frozen. See a doctor immediately.

                    above 125 degrees F (51 degrees C). Do not discard empty refrigerant containers where they are
                    likely to be subjected to the heat of trash burners, etc.; they may explode, resulting in personal
                    injury or possible death. Containers must be stored, installed, and disposed of in accordance with
                    all state and local ordinances.

                    equipment while the system is charged. Heat applied to any part will cause the pressure within the

                    conditioning system. Refrigerant is not combustible; however, in the presence of heat it changes to
                    a poisonous gas. Inhalation can cause death or serious injury.

            <warning>
                <para>Always use approved refrigerant recycling equipment when working with R-134a to prevent accidental
                    discharge. If released into the atmosphere, the refrigerant evaporates very quickly and may displace
                    the oxygen surrounding the work area, especially in small or enclosed areas. This situation creates
                    the hazard of suffocation or brain damage for anyone in the work area. If a leak should occur, avoid
                    breathing the refrigerant and lubricant vapor. Thoroughly ventilate the area before continuing with
                    service. Federal and state laws require that refrigerant be recovered and recycled to help protect
                    the environment.

                <para>With the manifold gauge set connected to both the air conditioning system and the refrigerant
                    supply cylinder, never open the high side hand valve of the manifold gauge set while the A/C system
                    is operating. If hot, high pressure refrigerant is forced through the gauge to the refrigerant
                    supply cylinder; it could cause the cylinder to rupture and cause personal injury.

                <para>When purging the system or components, do not use nitrogen at pressures over 862 kPa (125 psi).
                    Personal injury or death may result from doing so.

                <para>Always use correct replacement refrigerant hoses. Do not use hoses other than those specified for
                    the system being serviced. The use of improper hoses may cause a hose rupture, which may result in
                    personal injury.

                    tests, DO NOT turn either hand valve on the manifold gauge set for any reason. Equipment can be
                    damaged, and personal injury can result. When connected to the A/C system the gauges will indicate
                    the system pressures with the valves closed (fully CW). These valves are used only while
