        <title>Cab Squaring</title>
        <para>Cab squaring is the centering and perpendicular positioning of the cab structure to the frame. The cab
            must be squared whenever the cab has been removed from the chassis for repair, or if a new cab is being
            mounted.
        </para>
        <para>The cab must be properly squared to the frame as this will affect the relationship between the cab and
            hood. Improper squaring may result in unacceptable appearance and interference between the cab and hood.
            <emph type="bold">Be sure the chassis is on a level surface before squaring.</emph>
        </para>
        <para>Center cab on frame rail by measuring from inside of cab cowl to outside of frame rail on both sides.
            Measurement should be equal on both front and rear sides.
