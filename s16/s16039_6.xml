            <para>The heater/ventilation/air conditioning (HVAC) system contains both mechanical and electrical

            <para>Malfunctions in the HVAC system could be attributed to either mechanical or electrical failures in the

            <title>General Operation Of The HVAC Electrical System - Front HVAC System</title>
            <para>The controls on the front HVAC control head are used to adjust the cab air temperature mix, select the
                blower speed, and select the system operating mode, including recirculation and distribution of cab air.
                The blower speed is controlled by varying the amount of voltage applied to the blower motor. The
                temperature mix and system operating mode are selected by electronically controlling the actuators that
                position the air flow doors located in the evaporator and heater modules. The HVAC control head also
                communicates with the body controller to request compressor turn on (for AC and defrost operation).
            </para>
            <para>The control head communicates fault conditions to the body controller for certain conditions monitored
                by the control head (operation of the air door actuator motors). If the HVAC control head detects a
                fault condition the body controller will log a diagnostic trouble code.
            </para>
            <para>The body controller contains the circuitry and the software program that controls the cycling of the
                air conditioner compressor. In general the body controller monitors the refrigerant sensors (transducer
                and thermistors) and other system parameters to determine if all parameters are within acceptable
                limits. If parameters are acceptable, the body controller will turn on the compressor when requested by
                the HVAC control head, and will cycle the compressor to keep the system within acceptable operating
                parameters.
            </para>
            <para>When the body controller detects readings outside of the acceptable ranges, it will generate and log a
                diagnostic trouble code. If the body controller determines that continued operation would be
                destructive, it shuts down the A/C system by preventing the compressor from turning on.
