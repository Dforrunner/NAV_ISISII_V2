            <para>Cab squaring is the centering and perpendicular positioning of the cab structure to the frame. The cab
                must be squared whenever the cab has been removed from the chassis for repair, or if a new cab is being
                mounted.

            <para>The cab must be properly squared to the frame as this will affect the relationship between the cab and
                hood. Improper squaring may result in unacceptable appearance and interference between the cab and hood.
