        <title>AIR CONDITIONING SYSTEM CONTROLS</title>
        <svcprocinfo>
            <para>The air conditioning system controls consists of electrical switches connected in series with the
                compressor clutch to regulate compressor operation. The system controls accomplish the following three
                things:
            </para>
            <seqlist style="arabic">
                <item>
                    <para>Maintain cab temperature by controlling air and refrigerant flow.</para>
                </item>

                </item>
            </seqlist>
            <para>The electrical circuit is very basic. It begins as power from a fused protective source supplied to
                the fan speed switch. If all conditions are correct, the current then flows from one switch to the next,
                until it reaches the compressor clutch.

        <svcsubproc>
            <title>High Pressure Cutout Switch Operation</title>
            <para>The switch is mounted between the condenser outlet and the expansion valve inlet to monitor the
                operating pressures on the (liquid) high pressure side of the A/C system.
            </para>
            <para>The primary function of this switch is to prevent the compressor from operating under the following
                condition: The pressure on the high side exceeds the preset operating limits.
            </para>
        </svcsubproc>
        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Low Side - Low Pressure Cutout Switch Operation</title>
            <para>The switch is mounted between the compressor inlet and the expansion valve outlet to monitor the
                operating pressures on the (gas) low pressure side of the A/C system.
            </para>
            <para>The primary function of this switch is to prevent the compressor from operating under the following
                condition: The pressure on the low side is below the preset limits (i.e., a loss of refrigerant, low
                ambient temperature or system restriction).
            </para>
        </svcsubproc>
        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Thermostatic Switch</title>
            <para>The thermostatic control switch is a thermal device that controls an electrical switch. A connected
                refrigerant-filled capillary tube is inserted in the fins and tubes of the evaporator core. The
                capillary tube is attached to a bellows inside the thermostat, which in turn closes a set of contacts at
                a predetermined temperature. When the capillary tube senses 4.4 to 6.7&#176;C (40 to 44&#176;F), the
                thermostat closes, sending current to the magnetic clutch engaging the compressor, providing low
                pressure/low temperature liquid refrigerant to the evaporator. When the capillary tube senses -1.1 to
                1.1&#176;C (30 to 34&#176;F), the thermostat switch opens, disengaging the magnetic clutch so the
                evaporator does not freeze up and stop air flowing through it.
            </para>
        </svcsubproc>
        <svcsubproc>
            <title>A/C Switch</title>
            <para>The A/C switch is the evaporator thermostat. The TSTAT is wired in series with the A/C system ON/OFF
                switch. These switches are configured to switch to battery voltage when A/C compressor operation is
                desired.
