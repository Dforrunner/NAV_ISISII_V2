                <para>The CO 9670 cab is all aluminum and is assembled using the "unibody" method of construction. in
                    order to make a major repair, you should understand what this means. in "unibody" construction there
                    is no frame that other parts are fastened to. Each section has some built in stiffness. As the
                    sections are fastened together, the cab becomes stronger and stronger. in the finished cab
                    everything is locked together in a strong, rattle free, reliable unit. There are no weak spots to
                    develop problems as the miles roll up.
                </para>
                <para>Repairing one of these "unibody" cabs is not complicated, even when a lot of damage has been done.
                    Just locate which sections have been damaged, replace those that can't be straightened out in place,
                    and realign according to specifications. You don't need a special "jig" or workbench to do this.
