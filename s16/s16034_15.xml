        <title>OFF-SEASON CARE</title>
        <para>This system does not require any off-season maintenance. Do not remove compressor drive belt during the
            off-season, as clutch and compressor bearings may become brinneled. It is not necessary to operate the A/C
            system periodically during the off-season because the system uses the A/C compressor while in the defrost
            mode, if the ambient temperature is above freezing.
