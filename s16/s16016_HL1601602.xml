            <title>PRE-SEASON CHECKS AND OFF-SEASON CARE</title>
            <para>Experience has shown that many conditions incurred with heating and air conditioning systems result
                from lack of regular maintenance. Complete pre-season check outs and off season care of heating and air
                conditioning systems will aid in obtaining satisfactory performance during the operating seasons. These
                pre-season checks should be performed as outlined in GROUP 16, AIR CONDITIONING BASIC THEORY, SYSTEM
                DIAGNOSIS AND SERVICE with R-134a in the CTS-5000 Master Service Manual.
