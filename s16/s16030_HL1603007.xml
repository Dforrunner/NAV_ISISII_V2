                    <para>Replacement compressors contain a quantity of oil when shipped. This oil must be drained from
                        the new compressor before refilling the compressor (and system) with the correct amount of new
                        oil.

                    <para>During normal A/C operation, oil is circulated through the system with the refrigerant, and a
                        small amount is retained in each component. If certain components of the system are removed,
                        some of the refrigerant oil will go with the component. To maintain the original total oil
                        charge, it is necessary to compensate for the oil lost by adding oil to the system with the new
                        part.

            <para>The correct volume of refrigerant oil in the A/C system is critical for proper system operation.
                Insufficient oil will result in compressor failure. Too much oil decreases cooling efficiency, resulting
                in poor system cooling performance. In general, when servicing the system, ensure that the amount of oil
                (retained or added) in the repaired system (compressor and components) equals the total system oil
                capacity indicated in

                evacuation. The following paragraphs describe how to determine the quantity of refill oil needed under
                the most common conditions.
