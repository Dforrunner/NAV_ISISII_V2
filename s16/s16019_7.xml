        <title>PRINCIPLES OF AIR CONDITIONING</title>
        <para>When we hear the term air conditioning, usually the first thing that comes to mind is cold fresh air. In
            automotive applications, air conditioning is any system that cools and dehumidifies the air inside the
            passenger compartment of an automobile or truck.
        </para>
        <para>The air conditioning system installed in International trucks uses a special refrigerant to absorb heat
            inside the evaporator. To do this the refrigerant changes from a liquid to a vapor (latent heat of
            vaporization). Since the evaporator is located inside the cab, air blown over the fins of the evaporator
            becomes cool and is directed to the occupants of the cab for their comfort.
        </para>
        <para>It is necessary to remove the heat absorbed by the refrigerant inside of the evaporator. To do this, the
            refrigerant is recycled for reuse within the system. The heat is removed from the refrigerant (latent heat
            of condensation) and expelled into the outside air.
        </para>
        <para>The process of recycling the refrigerant starts at the compressor. The compressor pressurizes the
            heat-laden vapor until its pressure and temperature are much greater than that of the outside air. The
            compressor also pumps the vapor to the condenser. The condenser is located at the front of the vehicle and
            since the air passing over the fins of the condenser is much cooler than the vapor inside the condenser, the
            vapor gives up much of its heat to the outside air and changes back into a liquid. The liquid refrigerant
            then passes from the condenser to the receiver-dryer where it is stored until it is needed again by the
            evaporator.
        </para>
        <para>This example of heat removal demonstrates three basic laws of refrigeration which are the basics of all
            air conditioning systems.
        </para>
        <para>
            <title>LAW I</title>
        </para>
        <para>
            <emph type="bold">To refrigerate is to remove heat. The absence of heat is cold. Heat is ever present.
            </emph>
        </para>
        <para>Law I is illustrated by the air conditioning system of a truck. Heat is removed from the cab. In so doing,
            the temperature is lowered. The absence of heat is cold.
        </para>
        <para>
            <title>LAW II</title>
        </para>
        <para>
            <emph type="bold">Heat is ready to flow or pass to anything that has less heat. Nothing can stop the flow of
                heat; it can only be slowed down.
            </emph>
        </para>
        <para>Law II is demonstrated by the special refrigerant in the evaporator. In this instance, heat is ready to
            flow to anything that contains less heat.
        </para>
        <para>
            <title>LAW III</title>
        </para>
        <para>
            <emph type="bold">If a change of state is to take place, there must be a transfer of heat. If a liquid is to
                change to a gas, it must take on heat. The heat is carried off in a vapor. If a vapor is to change into
                a liquid, it must give up heat. The heat is given up to a less hot surface or medium.
            </emph>
        </para>
        <para>Law III is shown by the liquid refrigerant in the evaporator. That is, as the refrigerant takes on heat,
            it changes to a vapor. The heat is carried off to the condenser to be expelled outside the vehicle which in
            turn changes the vapor back into a liquid.
