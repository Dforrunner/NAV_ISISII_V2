        <para>Cold is the absence of heat. To understand cold, we must first understand what heat is. Heat is energy and
            is present at all times. Heat cannot be contained. As explained under HEAT, the structure of all things is
            changed into one of three forms by heat.
        </para>
        <para>All matter generates heat which is called
            <emph type="bold">specific heat</emph>. The body generates heat that must be overcome if one is to be cool.
            The food stored in a refrigerator generates heat that must be overcome if the food is to be kept at a safe
            temperature required for short or long term storage. Any matter that is to be cooled must first have its
            specific temperature lowered or overcome.
