        <title>BLOWER SPEED CONTROL RESISTORS AND THERMO-FUSES</title>
        <para>Each blower is operated by a three-position switch. Both switches are operated by the same lever in the
            control assembly. The switches are connected electrically to relays and blower speed control resistors.
            Prior to 12/91, the relays were located in the Blend-Air unit. In 12/91 the relays were moved to the
            component support bracket behind the passenger side dash. Blower motor relays in the 9600 and 9700 vehicles
            were relocated behind the passenger side kick panel in 2/92. The relays also contain thermo-fuses to protect
            the motor circuits in the event of a locked motor shaft or short circuit. The switches, relays and resistors
            provide three blower motor speeds, in addition to the OFF position.

        <para>The resistors for all the models are located in the Blend-Air unit.</para>
