        <title>CAB DOOR</title>
        <para>Getting a good cab door to door opening fit requires a knowledge of where the various adjustments are
            located and what effect each adjustment has on door fit. These adjustments apply whether door has been
            removed or door adjustment is simply being changed or improved.
        </para>
        <para>When the door is properly adjusted, it should fit the opening with 1/4 to 5/16 inch (6 to 8 mm) space all
            around the door frame. A newspaper sheet should not be able to pass between the weather seal and door frame
            (paper should tear).

            <para count="1">Door weather seal should contact the door frame with slight pressure but without damage to
                the seal.
