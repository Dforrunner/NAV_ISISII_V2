            <para>The compressor is driven by the vehicle engine and operates on demand by the air conditioning system
                through the magnetic clutch. During the down stroke, a slight vacuum is created between the top of the
                piston and the cylinder head causing the inlet valve to open. Refrigerant at a pressure of 12 to 50 psi
                is drawn into the cylinder. As the piston begins its upward stroke, the refrigerant that was drawn into
                the cylinder on the down stroke is being compressed. Pressure on the inlet valve allows it to close. The
                piston continues its upward stroke and refrigerant now compressed to 120-300 psi pushes the outlet valve
                open. Refrigerant flows through the open valve into the condenser.
