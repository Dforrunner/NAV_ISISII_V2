    <p>Refrigerant R-134a is a nonflammable, nonexplosive, and noncorrosive hydrofluorocarbon refrigerant. R-134a is
        heavier than air and has a slight ether-type odor. Although R-134a is classified as a safe refrigerant, the
        following precautions must be observed to protect the A/C system components and the person working on the
        system.</p>
