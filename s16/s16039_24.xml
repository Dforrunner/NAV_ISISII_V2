        <svcprocinfo>
            <para>An HVAC system is received for service because the operator feels that the system is not operating
                correctly. Usually, the operator will provide a symptom describing the operation of the system. In the
                following procedure, diagnosis begins by observing any Diagnostic Trouble Codes logged by the body
                controller. If no diagnostic trouble codes are displayed, the reported fault is verified by operating
                the system and observing the symptoms. Because the Fault Identification Procedure, Diagnostic Symptom
                Chart, and Troubleshooting Tables are organized in order of increasing confidence; any fault symptom
                must be resolved at its first appearance.

            <title>Diagnostic Trouble Codes</title>
            <para>The body controller monitors parameters throughout the A/C system and generates Diagnostic Trouble
                Codes (DTC's) whenever a monitored parameter falls outside of its specified range. When any DTC is
                generated it is stored in memory. Observing DTC's is one of the first steps in diagnosing a
                malfunctioning A/C system, as indicated in the following procedure. Always resolve active DTC's before
                troubleshooting symptoms.
