                        safety seat tether bracket assemblies (if equipped) and attaching hardware should be inspected
                        after any collision. Ford recommends new safety belt assemblies be installed unless a qualified
                        technician finds the assemblies show no damage and operate correctly. Safety belt assemblies not
                        in use during a collision should also be inspected and new assemblies installed if either damage
                        or incorrect operation is noted.
