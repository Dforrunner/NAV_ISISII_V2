            <para>The heater only system is a unit of different construction from the Blend-Air System. The list of
                components is the same as the shared and heater portions of the combined system although the
                configuration of some of them is different. Since most are the same, the service of both will be covered
                as one, with exceptions noted where they occur.
            </para>
            <para>The components discussed here are those of the in-cab heater and Blend-Air units only. For detailed
                information on the air conditioning system, refer to GROUP 16 - AIR CONDITIONING THEORY, SYSTEM
                DIAGNOSIS AND SERVICE, and AIR CONDITIONING COMPRESSOR AND CLUTCH in the CTS-5000 Master Service Manual.

            <para>The hot water valve (heater shut-off,
                <hotlnk document="s16014_1.xml" xrefid="f1601403">Figure 3</hotlnk>) is attached to the floor of the
                Blend-Air unit housing. It is placed in the heater core inlet hose and serves to meter the flow of hot
                engine coolant through the core. The flow control is accomplished by an adjustable link connecting the
                valve and the Blend-Air door, which in turn is controlled by a cable connected to the control panel HTR
                lever.
