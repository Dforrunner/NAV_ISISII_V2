        <title>RADIATOR SHUTTER OVERRIDE SWITCH</title>
        <para>Vehicles equipped with radiator shutters also have a pressure switch. This switch is also typically
            located in the refrigerant compressor discharge line (
            <hotlnk document="s16019_18.xml" xrefid="f1601921">Figure 20</hotlnk>).
        </para>
        <para>The shutter override switch is identical in appearance to the fan drive switch, but is set to operate at
            different pressure levels.
        </para>
        <para>The radiator shutters are held open by spring pressure and are closed by an air cylinder working against
            the spring(s). The switch operates a solenoid valve that shuts off the compressed air to the cylinder and
            allows the spring(s) to open the shutters. Refer to
            <hotlnk document="s16019_HL1601902.xml" xrefid="t1601904">SPECIFICATIONS</hotlnk>
            for the opening and closing pressures. For more detailed information, refer to GROUP 12-ENGINES and GROUP 8
            ELECTRICAL CIRCUIT DIAGRAMS in the Master Service Manual.
