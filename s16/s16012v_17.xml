        <title>OFF-SEASON CARE</title>
        <para>The most important facet of off-season care of the air conditioning system is periodic operation of the
            unit. Operating the unit for five minutes twice a month after engine warm-up keeps the compressor seals
            lubricated. If the seals dry out, they may crack and leak when the system is operated.
        </para>
        <para>In addition, if the system is not operated periodically, clutch and compressor bearings could become
            brinneled. This is caused by the continual hammering effect on the bearing surface in the same spot from
            normal vibration during operation.
        </para>
        <para>Do not remove compressor drive belt during the off-season, as clutch and compressor bearings may become
            brinneled.
        </para>
        <para>In general, any system containing automatic devices will function with less trouble if it is not permitted
            to remain idle over long periods.
