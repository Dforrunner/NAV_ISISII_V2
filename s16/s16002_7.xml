        <title>TYPES OF FINISHES</title>
        <para>The finish of a vehicle has two basic functions: to protect the body from corrosion and improve the
            appearance. There are two basic types of finishes: lacquers and enamels (urethanes are a type of enamel).
            The difference between the two is how they dry and cure. Lacquers dry by the evaporation of solvents.
            Enamels and urethanes cure by solvent evaporation and by cross-linking the paint molecules. Finishes are
            applied in either single stage or two stage (as in basecoat/clearcoat) methods. International vehicles have
            the basecoat/clearcoat type of finish.
