                    <para>The following paragraphs describe operation of the sleeper HVAC system only. On vehicles
                        equipped with sleeper cabs, separate control panels make it possible for the front and rear HVAC
                        systems to operate in different modes and at different temperatures. For rapid heating or
                        cooling of the entire cab/sleeper area both systems should be set to the same approximate
                        temperature range.

                </note>
            </specpara>
            <para>The addition of the sleeper HVAC system does not affect the operation of the front (cab) A/C system.
                All information covering the front HVAC system in these vehicles can be found in
                <hotlnk document="s16039_HL160390400.xml" xrefid="hl160390400">SYSTEM OPERATING CONTROLS - FRONT HVAC
                    SYSTEM</hotlnk>. The electrical control systems for the sleeper HVAC system are covered in the
                applicable ELECTRICAL CIRCUIT DIAGRAMS manual and/or ELECTRICAL SYSTEM TROUBLESHOOTING guide listed in
                ISIS.
            </para>
            <para>In general, the blower speed and air discharge temperature of the sleeper HVAC system can be adjusted
                from either the rear control panel or the sleeper HVAC switches located on the instrument panel. Also,
                the air conditioning mode is automatically requested by the sleeper HVAC controller whenever the active
                temperature control for the sleeper system is set to a temperature lower than the temperature currently
                being sensed by the temperature sensor in the rear HVAC unit. NOTE: To energize the A/C compressor, the
                engine must be running and the blower speed controls for both the front and rear HVAC systems must NOT
                be set to OFF.
