            <para>These Physical Checks are provided as general supplemental information. While not as precise as the
                step-by-step procedures, these checks provide a simple convenient method of determining the condition of
                the A/C refrigerant system. Perform these checks when referenced from the troubleshooting tables.

                    <para>Avoid contact with moving belts, pulleys and/or fan when making the following checks. Beware
                        of extremely high temperatures at compressor outlet (discharge) hoses and tubing, as personal
                        injury may result.

                <para count="1">With the system operating, feel all air conditioning system components and refrigerant
                    lines for proper operating temperatures, as indicated in the following paragraphs.
                </para>
                <para>In general, from the discharge side of the compressor along the high pressure line, through the
                    condenser and up to the filter-drier, everything should be hot or warm to the touch. The
                    filter-drier is normally at outside temperature. The expansion valve, evaporator and all the lines
                    on the low pressure side leading back to the compressor should be cool to the touch. Any deviation
                    from the above conditions may indicate a malfunction in the system.
                </para>
            </step1>
            <para>Malfunctions or stoppages may be indicated by extreme cold or frosted areas (example: a cold
                filter-drier frosted part way up indicates a stoppage or serious restriction in the filter-drier). A
                stoppage or severe restriction in the refrigerant system can be located by looking for these
                indications. The following is a brief description of symptoms or conditions that could exist if the
                vehicle air conditioning system is malfunctioning. The conditions are listed by system component.

            <title>Refrigerant Compressor</title>
            <specpara>
                <note>
                    <para>If the ambient temperature is very low, the engine may have to reach operating temperature
                        before the body controller will energize the A/C compressor. After warmup, underhood heat will
                        allow the compressor to cycle on at very low ambient temperatures.
                    </para>
                </note>
            </specpara>
            <para>Compressor problems are usually revealed in one of five ways: abnormal noise, seizure, leakage, high
                suction pressure, or low discharge pressure.
            </para>
            <specpara>
                <caution>
                    <para>In the following step, the A/C compressor should be turned in a clockwise (CW) direction only
                        (as viewed from the front).
                    </para>
                </caution>
            </specpara>
            <para>Resonant noises are not a cause for alarm. Irregular noise or rattles are likely caused by broken
                parts. To check for seizure, turn the engine off to de-energize the magnetic clutch and see if the drive
                plate can be turned. If it won't turn, the compressor has seized.
            </para>
            <para>Inspect the fittings, oil fill plug, and all gasket joints on the compressor for signs of refrigerant
                leakage.
            </para>
            <para>Verify that the wires to the compressor clutch are in good condition and have not become
                disconnected.
            </para>
        </svcsubproc>
        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Condenser</title>
            <para>The condenser is usually trouble-free. Normally, the temperature of the condenser outlet line is
                noticeably cooler than the inlet line.
            </para>
            <para>When road debris (such as leaves or dirt buildup) cakes up, airflow over the condenser fins is reduced
                and the air is not able to absorb enough heat to turn the hot refrigerant gas into a liquid. High
                discharge pressure will result. In these cases, carefully clean off the outer surface of the condenser
                with soap and water and compressed air; be careful not to bend the fins.
            </para>
            <para>High discharge pressure will also occur if the condenser's tubing is abnormally bent, restricting or
                blocking the flow of refrigerant. Frost will appear at the point where the flow of refrigerant is
                restricted.
            </para>
            <para>Less common internal blockage (foreign material or metallic grit buildup) will restrict or stop the
                flow of refrigerant.
            </para>
            <para>Inspect the fittings and the condenser tubing for signs of refrigerant leakage.</para>
            <para>Reduced performance may also result from excess oil in the refrigerant system. This excess oil tends
                to collect in the bottom of the condenser.
            </para>

        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Pressure Transducer</title>
            <para>Verify that the wires to the pressure transducer are in good condition and have not become
                disconnected.
            </para>
            <para>Inspect the transducer mounting for signs of refrigerant leakage.</para>
        </svcsubproc>
        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Thermistors</title>
            <para>Verify that the wires to the thermistors are in good condition and have not become disconnected.
            </para>
            <para>Inspect the thermistor mountings for signs of refrigerant leakage.</para>
        </svcsubproc>
        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Filter-Drier</title>
            <para>The filter-drier is normally at or near outside temperature. To the touch, the entire length of the
                unit should be the same temperature. If noticeable cold spots exist, replace the filter-drier.
            </para>
            <para>A blockage at the filter-drier will cause high head pressure and little or no cooling.</para>
        </svcsubproc>
        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Thermostatic Expansion Valve (TXV)</title>
            <para>Problems that start in the expansion valve show up as follows.</para>
            <randlist type="bullet">
                <item>
                    <para>When stuck closed, the evaporator core and expansion valve will be at outside temperature, and
                        the system will not cool.
                    </para>
                </item>
                <item>
                    <para>When stuck open, both the evaporator core and the valve will be extremely cold with possible
                        frost or ice buildup.
                    </para>
                </item>
            </randlist>
            <para>Because the expansion valve channels are very small, blockage in the system is usually found here (the
                valve is very sensitive to contamination). Usually the contamination is water. Less that a drop of water
                is all it takes to make the valve inoperative. When water reaches the valve, the extreme cold that
                results from the pressure drop freezes the water, forming an ice blockage. After the system shuts down
                and the valve warms up, the valve operates again, only to freeze up when the moisture returns and the
                temperature drops.
            </para>
            <para>Intermittent expansion valve freeze up indicates that the filter-drier is not removing the moisture
                from the system.
            </para>
        </svcsubproc>
        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Evaporator</title>
            <para>The evaporator core is basically trouble-free when air flow over the fins is not blocked. Normally,
                the evaporator outlet tube will feel cool to cold. External or, less often, internal blockage will cause
                low suction pressure as well as little or no cooling.
            </para>
            <para>Evaporator freeze-ups are the result of the moisture in the air condensing and then freezing on an
                evaporator core that is operating below 32&#176;F. The ice on the fins blocks the air flow through the
                evaporator and stops the cooling until the ice melts. Evaporator freeze-up may be caused by a faulty
                expansion valve or a problem with the sensing circuitry that controls the cycling of the A/C compressor
                (input thermistor circuit or output thermistor circuit).
            </para>
            <para>A flooded evaporator occurs when there is too much refrigerant flowing into the evaporator, and is
                generally caused by a faulty expansion valve. A starved evaporator occurs when there is not enough
                refrigerant flowing into the evaporator. Starvation can be caused by a faulty expansion valve or a low
                refrigerant charge. A starved evaporator may cause the evaporator outlet tube to feel warmer than usual:
                at or near ambient temperature.
            </para>
            <para>If a leak exists in the system, and it cannot be traced to other parts or fittings, suspect damage to
                the evaporator core.
            </para>
            <para>The evaporator is the most difficult of all the components to inspect visually because of its enclosed
                location. To detect airflow blockage due to debris, bent fins, and/or refrigerant leaks (oil smudges)
                inspect the inlet side of the evaporator.
            </para>
            <specpara>
                <caution>
                    <para>Never force the fresh/recirculate air door open. If the door position must be changed; turn on
                        key, set mode control to FLOOR, turn off key. Forcing the door will result in a broken door
                        shaft and a costly repair.
                    </para>
                </caution>
            </specpara>
            <para>To inspect the cowl mounted evaporator, the fresh air/recirculate air door must be in the open (fresh
                air) position (the mode control must not be set to the MAX A/C position). Remove the grille from the
                cowl tray air inlet, and remove the internal air filter. Using a flashlight and inspection mirror,
                inspect the inlet side of the evaporator core.
            </para>
        </svcsubproc>
        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Line Restrictions</title>
            <para>A restricted suction line causes low suction pressure at the compressor and little or no cooling. A
                restriction in a line between the compressor and the expansion valve can cause high discharge and low
                suction pressure, and poor cooling. Generally, if the line is not entirely blocked, the area immediately
                after the restriction will be cold. A completely blocked line will result in high head pressures and no
                cooling, but no physical symptoms at the blockage.
