        <para>After the repair has been completed, paint the area. Even though a number of air-drying enamels can be
            used, there is no universal paint which will adhere to thermoplastic. Most thermoplastic repairs require a
            special primer such as Sikkens Autocryl Filler for the paint to stick. If the thermoplastic has a sprayed on
            texture match the repair texture to the surrounding area with a texturing primer such as Dynatron/Bondo
            Corp. Dyna-Fill. Primers of this variety are to be applied and left to dry. DO NOT finish sand these
            primers.
        </para>
        <para>After priming, paint with Sikkens Autocryl Color followed by their Matting Clear. The gloss level can be
            adjusted by mixing it with Sikkens Auto Clear. Paint the repaired area so it blends in with the surrounding
            area.

        <para>For more painting information refer to GROUP 16 - PAINT section in the CTS-5000 Master Service Manual.
