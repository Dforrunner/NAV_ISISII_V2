        <title>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION</title>
        <para>When the MAX A/C mode is selected on the HVAC control, it will supply a drive voltage between connector
            (1200) terminals B1 and B2. This drive voltage is routed through circuits A74 and A74A, connector
            (4014)/(1701) terminals 22 and 23, and circuits J74 and J74A, to HVAC recirculation motor connector (4017)
            terminals A and F. This voltage will drive the motor to close the recirculation door, blocking the fresh air
            intake. The HVAC control head senses and counts the reflected pulses on the drive voltage line that verify
            motor rotation. Once the control head senses that the door is fully closed, the drive voltage will turn off.
        </para>
        <para>When any other mode is selected, the drive voltage supplied by the HVAC control will have the opposite
            polarity of the previous voltage. This voltage will drive the motor to open the recirculation door and the
            fresh air intake. Again the control voltage will stop once the door is fully open.
        </para>
        <para>If the HVAC control head senses that the recirculation motor is not operating correctly, it outputs a
            fault signal on its diagnostic line. This signal is output from terminal A9 of connector (1200) and is
            routed by circuit A75A to ESC connector (1600) terminal 8.
