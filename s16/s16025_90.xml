        <title>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION</title>
        <para>The AC refrigerant inlet thermistor is tied to the ESC zero volt reference level, at ESC connector (4004)
            terminal 26, through circuit J9A and circuit J9K to (4019) terminal B. The inlet thermistor is also supplied
            approximately 10 volts from ESC connector (4004) terminal 7, through circuit J77D to (4019) terminal A. The
            resistance of the thermistor, and therefore the amount of voltage dropped across the thermistor, will vary
            according to the temperature of the refrigerant being monitored by the thermistor. The ESC will use this
            information as one parameter involved in determining if, and when, the AC compressor should be turned on or
            off.

        <para>The AC refrigerant outlet thermistor is tied to the ESC zero volt reference level, at ESC connector (4004)
            terminal 26, through circuit J9A and circuit J9J to (4018) terminal B. The outlet thermistor is also
            supplied approximately 10 volts from ESC connector (4004) terminal 6, through circuit J77A to (4018)
            terminal A. This thermistor functions identically to the inlet thermistor to provide the ESC with another
            parameter involved in determining if, and when, the AC compressor should be turned on or off.
