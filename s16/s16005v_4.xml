        <title>CAB AIR SUSPENSION SYSTEM</title>
        <para>The cab air suspension system on International vehicles contains one or two air springs (bags), two shock
            absorbers, and is controlled by the cab air ride valve or height control valve. These components may be
            removed and replaced if required. Refer to the REMOVE AND INSTALL section for the proper procedure for the
            specific cab air suspension system being serviced.
        </para>
        <para>The cab air ride valve or height control valve is pre-set at the factory and under normal conditions does
            not have to be adjusted. However, there is an adjustment procedure for service when needed, except for 9200,
            9300 and 9400 with Pro Sleeper (after May 1997). Refer to the ADJUSTMENTS section for the specific cab air
            suspension system being adjusted.
