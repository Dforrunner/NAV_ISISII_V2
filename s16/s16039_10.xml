            <para>Malfunctions in the HVAC system could be attributed to either mechanical or electrical failures in the

            <title>General Operation Of The Sleeper HVAC Electrical System</title>
            <para>The rear HVAC controller adjusts the blower speed and temperature setting of the sleeper HVAC system,
                based on the settings of the sleeper HVAC controls. The blower speed is controlled by varying the amount
                of voltage applied to the blower motor, via the LPM. The temperature mix is selected by electronically
                controlling the actuator that positions the blend air door. When the temperature settings call for
                cooler temperatures, the controller communicates with the body controller to request refrigerant
                compressor turn on (for A/C operation).
            </para>
            <para>The rear HVAC controller also communicates fault conditions to the body controller for certain
                conditions monitored by the controller. If the HVAC controller detects a fault condition, the body
                controller will log a diagnostic trouble code.
