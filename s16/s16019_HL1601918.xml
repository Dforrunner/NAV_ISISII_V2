            <title>OIL IN CCI COMPRESSORS</title>
            <para>Effective approximately February 1, 1995, all CCI refrigerant compressors used in truck production
                were filled with Ester Oil. Prior to this date, all CCI refrigerant compressors were filled with PAG
                oil. If it is necessary to add refrigerant oil to an early production A/C system with a CCI compressor,
                check the label on the compressor to verify the type of oil currently in the system. If the compressor
                is currently filled with PAG oil, we recommend that the PAG oil be drained from the compressor and
                refilled with Ester Oil.

                    <para>If the compressor is refilled with Ester oil, it is recommended that the oil identification on
                        the label on the compressor be changed to reflect the change in oil.

                Sanden compressor was available only as an option.
