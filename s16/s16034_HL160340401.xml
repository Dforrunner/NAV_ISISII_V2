        <title>PRE-SEASON SERVICING</title>
        <para>Experience has shown that many unsatisfactory conditions incurred with heating and air conditioning
            systems result from lack of regular maintenance. Preventive maintenance and cleanliness of all components
            within the system are extremely important. A complete step-by-step pre-season checkout of the air
            conditioner/heater system will substantially increase satisfactory operation during the operating season.
        </para>
        <para>Perform the following procedures:</para>
        <step1>
            <para count="1">Check the mounting fasteners of each component for looseness.</para>
        </step1>
        <step1>
            <para count="1">Check condition, tension and alignment of all drive belts. Refer to GROUP 12- ENGINE section
                in the Master Service Manual.

            <para count="1">Verify that the vehicle coolant level is correct.</para>
        </step1>
        <step1>
            <para count="1">Check refrigerant hose retention and condition. Look for cracks, chafing, or other damage.
                Inspect all tubing and hoses for dirty or loose connections. All connections must be clean and tight.

            <note>
                <para>If a patch of oily residue is found at or near a connection it may indicate a refrigerant leak.
                    Note its location in case a system operational test indicates a refrigerant leak or a low
                    refrigerant condition.

                <para>Cleanliness of the air conditioner components cannot be over-emphasized. Lack of proper attention
                    in this area is one of the major causes of costly and unsatisfactory unit operation.

            <caution>
                <para>Never force the fresh/recirculate air door open. If the door position must be changed; turn on
                    key, set mode control to FLOOR, turn off key. Forcing the door will result in a broken door shaft
                    and a costly repair.
