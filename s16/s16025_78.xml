        <title>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION</title>
        <para>Air flow through the HVAC duct work is directed by the two mode doors. When a mode is selected by the mode
            control, the HVAC control head will supply a drive voltage between connector (1200) terminals B9 and B10.
            This drive voltage is routed through circuits A74B and A74C, and connector (1210) terminals A and B, to mode
            actuator connector terminals A and B. The voltage will drive the mode actuator motor which will position the
            two mode doors, via a gear drive system (kinematics). The HVAC control head senses and counts the reflected
            pulses on the drive voltage line that verify motor rotation. Once the HVAC control head senses that the
            actuator motor has rotated enough to correctly position the doors, the drive voltage will turn off.
        </para>
        <para>If the HVAC control head senses that the mode actuator motor is not operating correctly, it outputs a
            fault signal on its diagnostic line. This signal is output from terminal A9 of connector (1200) and is
            routed by circuit A75A to ESC connector (1600) terminal 8.
