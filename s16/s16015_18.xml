            <title>PRE-SEASON CHECKS AND OFF-SEASON CARE</title>
            <para>Experience has shown that many problems incurred with heating and air conditioning systems result from
                lack of regular maintenance. Complete pre-season checkouts and off-season care of heating and air
                conditioning systems will aid in obtaining satisfactory performance during the operating seasons. For
                more detailed information, refer to GROUP 16-AIR CONDITIONING BASIC THEORY, SYSTEM DIAGNOSIS AND SERVICE
                in the Master Service Manual, for the vehicle being serviced.
