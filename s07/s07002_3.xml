            <title>Exhaust System</title>
            <para>The exhaust system will vary by wheelbase. The exhaust system provides an exit for exhaust gases and
                reduces engine noise by passing exhaust gases through a catalytic converter and muffler assembly. Rubber
                exhaust hanger isolators attach the exhaust system to the mounting hooks.

        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Catalytic Converter</title>
            <para>The catalytic converter is part of the catalytic converter and muffler assembly and plays a major role
                in the emission control system. The catalytic converter operates as a gas reactor. Its catalytic
                function is to speed the heat-producing chemical reaction of components in the exhaust gases in order to
                reduce air pollutants. The catalyst material inside the catalytic converter consists of a ceramic
                substrate.
            </para>
            <para>The catalytic converter is designed to provide a long life. No maintenance is necessary for the
                catalytic converter.

                <warning>
                    <para>The normal operating temperature of the exhaust system is very high. Never work around or
                        attempt to repair any part of the exhaust system until it has cooled. Use special care when
                        working around the catalytic converter. The catalytic converter heats to a high temperature
                        after only a short period of engine operation. Failure to follow these instructions may result
                        in personal injury.

                <warning>
                    <para>Exhaust gases can be harmful to health and are potentially lethal. Exhaust system leaks should
                        be repaired immediately. Never operate the engine in enclosed areas. Failure to follow these
                        instructions may result in personal injury.

                <caution>
                    <para>Do not use oil or grease-based lubricants on the isolators. These lubricants may cause
                        deterioration of the rubber. This can lead to separation of the isolator from the exhaust hanger
                        bracket during vehicle operation.
