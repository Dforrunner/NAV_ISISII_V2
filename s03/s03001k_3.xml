            <hotlnk document="s03001k_2.xml" xrefid="f0300103">Figure 3</hotlnk>illustrates the height control valve in
            the neutral (closed position). At this point, the lever is parallel to the ground and the air suspension has
            been properly inflated to level the vehicle. No air can pass through the valve at this time.
        </para>
        <para>When a load is applied, such as coupling a trailer to the tractor, the frame lowers. The lever is moved
            through an angle above horizontal and the valve opens. As air passes through the valve and the air
            suspension inflated, the frame resumes its level attitude.
        </para>
        <para>The frame rises when the trailer is uncoupled. The lever moves through an angle below horizontal and once
            the time delay is surpassed, the valve exhausts air until the frame once again resumes its level attitude.
