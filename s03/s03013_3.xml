            illustrates the height control valve in the neutral (closed position). At this point, the lever is parallel
            to the ground and the air suspension has been properly inflated to level the vehicle. No air can pass
            through the valve at this time.
        </para>
        <para>When a load is applied, the frame lowers. The lever is moved through an angle above horizontal and the
            valve opens. As air passes through the valve and the air suspension inflates, the frame resumes its design
            height.
        </para>
        <para>The frame rises when the load is diminished. The lever moves through an angle below horizontal and once
            the time delay is surpassed, the valve exhausts air until the frame once again resumes its design height.
