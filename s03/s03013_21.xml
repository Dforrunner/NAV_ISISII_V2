        <para>With the "Suspension Dump Feature" the air piping for the system includes an air switch (Figure 29 and

            <para count="1">The control valve in the switch panel has two positions. In the on position the valve is
                closed. Placing the valve in the Dump position opens the valve and sends air pressure to the leveling
                valve.

            <para count="1">The air supply to the height control valve, air comes from the pressure protection valve.
                Air is delivered from the height control valve which distributes air to the tight and left air spring.

                    causing it to stop the air supply to the air springs and dumps the air from the air springs.

                    to the height control valve and the air springs will inflate until the vehicle is at ride height.
