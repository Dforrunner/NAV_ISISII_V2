        <title>BEAM CENTER CROSS TUBE</title>
        <para>The beam center cross tube connects the two equalizing beams through the nylon beam center bushings (
            <hotlnk document="s03011_6.xml" xrefid="f0301109">Figure 9</hotlnk>). The cross tube has clearance to float
            in the nylon bushings. The length of the cross tube will allow side float of approximately 2-1/4 inches. For
            this reason, the cross tube may appear polished at each end where it enters into the center bushings. This
            is normal.
        </para>
        <para>A cross tube very seldom requires replacement, usually only when it has been bent, possibly due to hitting
            an unseen object. A bent cross tube will cause misalignment of the axles, and must be replaced immediately
            to eliminate abnormal tire wear.
