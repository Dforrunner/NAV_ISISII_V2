            illustrates the height control valve in the neutral (closed) position. At this point, the lever is
            horizontal and the air suspension has been properly inflated to the correct air spring height. No air can
            pass through the valve in this position.
        </para>
        <para>When a load is applied, such as coupling a trailer to the tractor, the frame lowers. The lever is moved
            through an angle above horizontal and the valve opens. As air passes through the valve and the air
            suspension inflates, the suspension attains the correct air spring height.
        </para>
        <para>The frame rises when the trailer is uncoupled. The lever moves through an angle below horizontal and once
            the time delay is surpassed, the valve exhausts air until the suspension attains the correct air spring
            height.
