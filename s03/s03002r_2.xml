                illustrate the height control valve in the neutral (closed) position. At this point, the lever is
                parallel to the road surface and the air suspension has been properly inflated to level the vehicle. No
                air passes through the valve in the neutral position.
            </para>
            <para>During tractor operation, the built-in delay feature dampens random input from typical road shock
                (bumps and chuckholes) to keep the valve from cycling between opening and closing.
            </para>
            <para>When a load is applied, such as coupling a trailer to the tractor, the frame lowers. The lever is
                moved through an angle above horizontal and the valve opens after the time delay is surpassed. As air
                passes through the valve and the air suspension inflates, the frame resumes its level attitude.
            </para>
            <para>The frame rises when the trailer is uncoupled. The lever moves through an angle below horizontal and
                once the time delay is surpassed, the valve exhausts air until the frame once again resumes its level
                attitude.
