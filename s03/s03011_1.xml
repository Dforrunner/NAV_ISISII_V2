            <para>Proper service and repair are important to the safe and reliable operation of the tandem suspension.
                The service procedures recommended by International and described in this technical publication are
                effective methods of performing maintenance.
            </para>
            <para>There are various warnings and cautions that should be read carefully to minimize the risk of personal
                injury and to assure that proper methods are used. Improper servicing may damage the vehicle or render
                it unsafe in operation.

                    <para>Hendrickson Suspension reminds users to adhere to the published capacity ratings for the
                        suspensions. Add-on axle attachments and other load transferring devices can increase the
                        suspension load above the rated and approved capacities which could result in failure and loss
                        of vehicle control, possibly causing personal injury or property damage.

                    <para>Do not modify or rework parts. Do not use substitute parts. Use of a modified or substitute
                        part is not recommended because the part may not meet Hendrickson's specifications, which could
                        result in failure of the part, loss of vehicle control, and possible personal injury or property
                        damage.

                    <para>Do not use a cutting torch to remove any attaching fasteners. Do not use a cutting torch to
                        remove the equalizing beams from the axles or to remove the bushings from the beam centers or
                        ends. Welding, torching or attaching material to the equalizing beams must never be performed.
                        The use of heat on suspension components will adversely affect the strength of these parts. A
                        component damaged in this manner may result in the loss of vehicle control and possible personal
                        injury or property damage.
