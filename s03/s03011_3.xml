        <title>ALIGNMENT</title>
        <para>The primary control for alignment is the location of the saddles on the frame rail by the vehicle
            manufacturer, and the location of the axle brackets as installed by the axle manufacturer.
        </para>
        <para>Hendrickson has two styles of beam end connections. The most common connection uses rubber bushings with
            beam end adapters. The other style is a Bar Pin bushing discussed later in this publication which has an
            alignment feature. If you have the Bar Pin style end connection, refer to GROUP 03 - SUSPENSIONS in the
            CTS-5000 Master Service Manual for detailed alignment instructions.
