                <warning>
                    <para>To prevent vehicle damage, personal injury, or possible death, park the vehicle on a flat,
                        level surface. Make sure the engine ignition is in the off position and the transmission is in
                        neutral or in the park position if the vehicle is equipped with an automatic transmission. Set
                        the parking brake, chock the wheels, and disconnect the batteries at the negative terminal
                        before doing any service procedures on the engine or vehicle.

                <warning>
                    <para>A jack must never be used alone to support a vehicle while under chassis service is being
                        performed. The jack may lower and serious personal injury could result. Always support vehicle
                        with floor stands.

                <caution>
                    <para>Suspension fasteners are critical parts because they affect performance of vital parts and
                        systems and their failure can result in major service expense. A new part with the same part
                        number must be installed if installation becomes necessary. Do not use a replacement part of
                        lesser quality or substitute design. Torque values must be used as specified during reassembly
                        to make sure of correct retention of these parts.
