            <para>Wheel, hub and drum assembly removed.</para>
            <para>The wheel seals are removed using a brass drift and hammer. Position the drift through the outer
                opening of hub and against the inner bearing. Tap bearing and seal out through the brake drum side of
                hub. Take care so that seal bore is not damaged.

                <note>
                    <para>Never use a steel punch to remove inner bearing and seal. Possible damage to the bearing or
                        seal bore may occur and the bearing and cup will have to be replaced.

            <para>Wheel, hub and drum assembly removed.</para>
            <para>If outer seal assembly is still in the hub, then remove seal and inner bearing as described above.
            </para>
            <para>Remove inner bearing from spindle. Use a small hammer to tap seal off the wear ring. To remove the
                seal wear ring, use a ball peen hammer to tap in several places around the wear ring. This action will
                expand the wear ring, then it can be removed from the spindle.
            </para>
            <para>Do not use a chisel to cut the ring since the chisel could damage the machined surface of the
                spindle.
