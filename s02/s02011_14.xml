            <para count="1">Screw the lower kingpin ball stud into the spindle yoke until the top of the threaded
                portion is flush with the inside surface of the yoke. Make sure that the locating pin for the lower
                kingpin lockwasher is in the yoke, then loosely install the lockwasher and nut

            <para count="1">Smear the spherical portion of the lower kingpin ball stud with grease. Roll the jack
                forward and grasping the assembly with both hands, place the lower ball stud into its bearing in the
                suspension yoke. Raise the jack and rotate the top of the spindle yoke over the upper axle tube yoke.

                the 7/8" locknut on the bolt and tighten to 500 ft-lbs. (678 N&#183;m).
