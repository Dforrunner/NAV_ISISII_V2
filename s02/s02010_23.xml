        <para>Prior to re-assembly, parts which are to be reused must be carefully inspected for signs of wear or
            damage. Replacement of such parts can prevent costly downtime at a future date.
        </para>
        <para>All bearing surfaces, including ball bearing assemblies and roller bearing cups and cones, should be
            examined for pitting, wear, or overheating. Shafts may be nicked and marred, or may have damaged threads.
            Parts which show any signs of damage should be repaired or replaced.
