        <title>DIFFERENTIAL CARRIER</title>
        <para>Differential carrier should have the lubricant changed at the same intervals as the rear axle on the
            vehicle or at 10,000 mile intervals. Drain while lubricant is warm. Clean the magnetic drain plug when it is
            removed. Remove the fill plug to ensure quicker drainage. Allow housing to drain completely. Install the
            drain plug and fill the housing with the appropriate gear oil to the bottom of the fill plug hole. Check for
            leaks. SAE 140 gear oil (meeting MIL-L-2105C) is appropriate for most operating conditions. Follow the
            vehicle manufacturer's recommendations for the rear axle and apply them to the front axle under other
            conditions.
