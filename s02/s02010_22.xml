        <para>Soft, clean shop towels should be used to dry parts after cleaning. Compressed air may be used to clean
            accessible areas of large parts such as the housing. Bearings should not be spun dry with compressed air, as
            the lack of lubrication may cause damage to the mating surfaces.
        </para>
        <para>Dry parts should be immediately coated with a light oil or corrosion inhibitor to prevent corrosion
            damage. Parts which are to be stored should also be wrapped in heavy waxed paper.
