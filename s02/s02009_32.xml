                than 4000 hours, the lubricant should be changed twice yearly.

            <para>In the event the gear carrier housing should become submerged in water, particularly if over the vent,
                it is recommended that the lubricant be drained and internal parts inspected for water damage and/or
                contamination prior to assembling the carrier to the housing and refilling with the specified lubricant.

            <title>After Overhaul</title>
            <para>When refilling the axle assembly after it has been disassembled for service, the lubricant should be
                filled to the bottom of the fill hole located in the bowl of the axle housing. After 24 hours of
                operation, recheck the lubricant level and bring it up to the bottom of the fill hole again, if
                necessary. This procedure is recommended to replenish the small amount of lubricant that is retained in
                the differential support case during initial operation of the axle immediately following an overhaul.
