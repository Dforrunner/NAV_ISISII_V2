            <para>Proper service and repair of drive axles and their components is important for safe and reliable
                operation. The procedures recommended and described in this service manual are tested and effective
                methods for performing service operation. Follow each procedure closely, making use of both text and
                illustrations. Some of these procedures show the use of certain tools designed especially for the
                operation being performed. Special tools should be used when recommended and in the method described. It
                is impossible to know and advise the service trade of all conceivable ways in which service might be
                performed or of the hazardous consequences of each. Accordingly, anyone who uses a service procedure or
                tool which is not recommended must first satisfy himself that neither his safety nor the vehicle safety
                will be jeopardized by the service methods he selects.
