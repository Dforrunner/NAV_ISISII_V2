            <para>Driving forces are put into the axle at the pinion yoke on the differential carrier; they pass through
                the differential to the inner axle shafts and the inner drive yoke of the universal joint. They then
                pass into the outer drive yoke and the outer axle shaft, which connects to the wheel hub and wheel.
            </para>
            <para>When steered, the outer section of each steerable drive end turns about the kingpin centerline. The
                universal joint is centered on the kingpin centerline and allows driving forces to turn with the steered
                wheel ends.
            </para>
            <para>The axle can be equipped with air or hydraulic brakes. The brake shoes expand to contact conventional
                brake drums.

            <para>The front drive axle can be shifted into operation for improved traction where the rear wheels may
                lose traction while operating in loose dirt, sand, mud, snow, or ice. Engagement can be accomplished at
                any vehicle speed as long as the rear axle wheels are not spinning. Engagement is best accomplished with
                engine pulling lightly.
