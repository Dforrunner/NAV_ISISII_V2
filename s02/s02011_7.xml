                    taken to ensure that water is kept out of the assembly by tightly closing breather caps and other
                    openings.

                    may be immersed in a hot solution tank containing a mild alkaline solution. Parts cleaned in hot
                    solution tanks must be rinsed thoroughly to prevent damage by traces of alkaline material.

                    with emulsion cleaners or petroleum solvents. Alkaline hot solution tanks may damage the machined
