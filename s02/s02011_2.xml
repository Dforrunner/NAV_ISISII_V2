        <para>In conditions where the vehicle's rear wheels might spin, such as sand, loose dirt, mud, snow, ice, or
            ascending grades, the front drive axle can be shifted into operation for improved traction.
        </para>
        <para>Power (torque) is put into the axle at the pinion yoke on the differential carrier; it passes through the
            differential to the inner axle shafts and on to the universal joints. The yoke shafts get their power from
            the U-joints and transfer it by means of splines to the drive flanges, which are bolted to the wheel hubs,
            thus rotating the wheels.
