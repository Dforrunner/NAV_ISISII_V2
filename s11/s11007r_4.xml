        <title>ADJUSTMENT</title>
        <svcsubsecinfo>
            <para>To assure correct clutch operation and long service life of clutch components, clutch and linkage must
                be kept in proper adjustment.
            </para>
            <para>Adjustment factors are clutch release bearing clearance and clutch pedal free travel. Pedal free
                travel is determined by release bearing clearance.
            </para>
            <para>Adjustment must be made periodically to compensate for wear of clutch disc facings (as indicated by
                reduction of pedal free travel) and at the time of clutch or clutch control linkage service.
            </para>
            <para>Some clutches have a self-adjusting feature which automatically maintains proper release bearing
                clearance to compensate for wear of the clutch disc facings. However, initial settings must be
                established by manual adjustment at the time of clutch or clutch control linkage service.
            </para>
            <para>Adjustment procedures, which vary between clutch types, are outlined in the specific clutch sections
                in GROUP 11 - CLUTCH of the CTS-5000 Master Service Manual.
