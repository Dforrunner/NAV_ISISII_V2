            <para>The clutch is used to transfer engine power from the flywheel to the transmission. When clutch
                engagement is initiated, the transmission input shaft may be stationary, as when the vehicle is at a
                standstill, or rotating, as in upshifting or downshifting. When full engagement is achieved, the
                flywheel and transmission input shaft will rotate at the same speed.
            </para>
            <para>To perform this function, the clutch is equipped with a disc(s) which has friction surfaces called
                facings. When the clutch pedal in the cab is depressed, the pressure is moved away from the flywheel
                freeing the disc(s) from contact with the flywheel friction surface.
