        <title>CLEAN</title>
        <para>Cleanliness is important. Dirt and foreign material that gets into the steering system during repair
            operations can cause damage or a possible steering malfunction at a later date. Due to the close tolerances
            between mating parts, it is best to have all parts at the same temperature for reassembly.
        </para>
        <para>Clean the machined parts individually to avoid damage caused by "bumping" together. Use clean solvent to
            wash parts. Dry the parts with compressed air. Nicks or burrs must be removed with a fine hand stone before
            assembly. Use clean lubricant to coat parts for assembly.
        </para>
        <specpara>
            <warning>
                <para>Wear safety glasses or goggles when using compressed air. Be careful using compressed air to dry
                    parts. Failure to do so could result in personal injury.
                </para>
            </warning>
        </specpara>
        <para>All hoses, lines and the reservoir should be cleaned before re-installing a repaired steering gear or
            after pump replacement. Replace the filter element or cartridge.
