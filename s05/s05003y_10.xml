        <title>UNLOADING (POPPET) VALVES</title>
        <para>Most TAS gears are equipped with two unloading valves, one at each end of the rack piston. One valve or
            the other, depending on the direction of the turn, will trip as the steered wheels approach the axle stops
            (which must be set according to manufacturer's specification). The tripped valve reduces pressure in the
            gear and helps to reduce heat generated by the pump. At the same time, the valves also reduce forces on the
            steering linkage. These valves are automatically set to axle stops after installation in the vehicle at
            first full right and left turn.
