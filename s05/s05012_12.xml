        <title>STEERING WHEEL ALIGNMENT</title>
        <para>Proper steering wheel-to-steering gear alignment is designed into the steering assembly. Following are a
            few alignment points to check at assembly or when steering wheel alignment is a problem:
        </para>
        <step1>
            <para count="1">Test drive vehicle on a straight and level (no crown) section of road for at least one
                quarter mile. Determine if or how far off center the steering wheel is when the vehicle is going
                straight.
            </para>
        </step1>
        <step1>
            <para count="1">If steering wheel alignment is off, return vehicle to work area for further adjustment. Stop
                vehicle with front road wheels (not steering wheel) straight ahead as indicated by driving test.
            </para>
        </step1>
        <step1>
            <para count="1">Proper steering wheel-to-steering gear alignment can be accomplished by removing the
                steering wheel (refer to

                steering wheel onto the splines of the steering column shaft.
            </para>
