            <para>Cleanliness is important. Dirt and foreign material that gets into the steering system during repair
                operations can cause damage or a possible steering malfunction at a later date. Due to the close
                tolerances between mating parts, it is best to have all parts at the same temperature for reassembly.
            </para>
            <para>Clean the machined parts individually to avoid damage caused by "bumping" together. Use clean solvent
                to wash parts. Dry the parts with compressed air. Nicks or burrs must be removed with a fine hand stone
                before assembly. Use clean lubricant to coat parts for assembly.

                <warning>
                    <para>Wear safety glasses or goggles when using compressed air. Be careful using compressed air to
                        dry parts. Failure to do so could result in personal injury.

            <para>All hoses, lines and the reservoir should be cleaned before re-installing a repaired steering gear or
                after pump replacement. Replace the filter element or cartridge.
