            <para>All parts must be thoroughly cleaned and kept clean during inspection and assembly. The close
                tolerance of the parts makes this important. Clean all removed parts, using a commercial solvent that is
                compatible with the system fluid. Compressed air may be used in cleaning, but it must be filtered to
                remove water and other contaminants. Clean, compressed air is particularly useful in cleaning spools,
                orifices and cover passages.

                    them dry with filtered, compressed air and place them on a clean surface for inspection.
