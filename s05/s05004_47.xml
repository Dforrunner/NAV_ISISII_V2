        <title>UNIVERSAL JOINTS</title>
        <para>Universal joints are designed to operate best when the angle between the drive and driven shafts is a
            maximum of 20 to 25 degrees. Angles greater than this will cause undesirable velocity changes between the
            two shafts. This velocity change may upset steering performance. When two universal joints are used, it is
            in most instances possible to phase the two joints to match a high and low velocity in a manner that will
            provide equal velocity between the drive and driven shafts. A third universal joint in the shaft arrangement
            can upset the phasing of the first two joints and it is important that this third joint operating angle is
            limited to a maximum of 20 to 25 degrees.
        </para>
        <para>Phasing of the universal joints in the steering column can be checked quite easily. Using an inch-pound
            graduated dial reading type torque wrench, read the variation in the torque reading while steering from
            lock-to-lock, with a socket on the steering shaft nut under the horn button. Variation of more than 15
            in-lbs. (1.7 Nm) indicates improper phasing. This reading is taken with the vehicle stationary and the
            engine running.
        </para>
        <para>Phasing can usually be accomplished by rotating the two piece intermediate shaft one spline at a time
            until the torque reading remains the same all the way around the 360 degree rotation of the steering wheel.
