                    <para>The steering column assemblies used on 2000, 3000, 4000, and 8000 Series are constructed with
                        a few minor differences; however, the overall design and function are similar.

                <lev1>
                    <para>The steering wheel, containing the horn switch mechanism, is connected to the upper steering
                        column shaft. On conventional cab models, the upper steering column shaft passes through the
                        steering column housing assembly and connects with the lower steering column shaft at a
                        double-yoke assembly with the aid of a spider-type universal joint. The steering column housing
                        is fastened to the dash panel via two support bracket assemblies, of which the bracket closest
                        to the steering column incorporates the tilt-column mechanism on models equipped with an
                        adjustable steering column.

                <lev1>
                    <para>On flat back cowl (FBC) and bus models, the steering column housing and support bracket
                        assemblies are replaced by a steering column support tube with its own mounting brackets. Models
                        equipped with adjustable columns also have the tilt mechanism incorporated in the
                        support-mounting bracket assembly. As on regular cab models, the upper and lower steering column
                        shafts are connected with a double-yoke U-joint assembly.

                    <para>On all 2000, 4000, and 8000 Series chassis, the lower steering column shaft is joined to the
                        steering gear by a double-yoke U-joint and end yoke pinch bolt assembly.

                <lev1>
                    <para>The stationary (fixed) steering column cannot be repositioned. The adjustable (sliding)
                        steering column assembly can be moved toward or away from the driver. The adjustment lever is
                        located on the left side of the steering column. To adjust the column position, pull the lever
                        up and move the column to the desired position. Release the lever to lock the column in
                        position.
