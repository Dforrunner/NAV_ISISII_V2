            <title>WEAR, BACKLASH, ADJUSTMENTS</title>
            <para>Because most of the steering action is performed near the center, or straight-ahead position, maximum
                wear occurs in the center of the worm. To give a long service life to the steering gear assembly, the
                wear is compensated for by introducing backlash in the off center position. This permits re-adjustment
                for lost motion in the center position without causing a bind in the off-center travel. (The backlash
                occurs approximately one-half turn each way from the center position and gradually increases to develop
                the largest amount of backlash at the end of gear travel.)
            </para>
            <para>Therefore, elimination of lost motion, due to wear, in the gear mechanism is accomplished by means of
                preload adjustments which are provided for on the worm bearings and mesh of the output shaft.

                <note>
                    <para>It is recommended before disturbing the steering gear adjustments, that all other sources of
                        wear in the steering linkage be first checked for free play.
