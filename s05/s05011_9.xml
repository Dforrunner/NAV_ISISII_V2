        <para>Proper steering wheel-to-steering gear alignment is designed into the steering assembly. The following are
            a few alignment points to check at assembly or when steering wheel alignment is a problem.

            <para count="1">Test drive the vehicle on a straight and level (no crown) section of road for at least one
                quarter of a mile. Determine if or how far off center the steering wheel is when the vehicle is going
                straight.
