        <title>EXTERNAL INSPECTION</title>
        <para>The second step is an external inspection. Look for the obvious defects first to save time.</para>
        <step1>
            <para count="1">Check hydraulic fluid reservoir for correct level.</para>
            <step2>
                <para count="1">Insufficient oil will cause loss of pressure and hard steering. An extremely low supply
                    may allow air to enter the system, causing a "growling" noise and a "lump" in steering.
                </para>
            </step2>
            <step2>
                <para count="1">A reservoir overflow means it is too full, the filter is out of place or in bad
                    condition.
                </para>
            </step2>
        </step1>
        <step1>
            <para count="1">Check tire pressure and tire wear due to improper alignment or balance. Improper alignment
                can cause hard steering and other undesired steering actions.
            </para>
        </step1>
        <step1>
            <para count="1">Check system for external leakage. Leakage is usually indicated by an oil wetted area, oil
                dripping or oily dirt accumulation.
            </para>
            <para>Since air and fan draft have probably spread leaking oil, clean the entire system off thoroughly, then
                operate and watch for leakage. Usual points for leaks are around fittings or along hoses which have
                burst or split under stress and strain.
            </para>
            <para>Leakage can cause the same troubles as a low oil supply in the reservoir and a "lump" or hard spot in
                steering. Air occasionally causes shimmy too.
