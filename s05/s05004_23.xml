            <para>Cleanliness is of utmost importance. Dirt and foreign material introduced into the steering system
                during repair operations can cause damages and steering malfunctions at a later date. Due to the close
                tolerances between mating parts, it is advisable to have all parts at the same temperature for
                reassembly.
            </para>
            <para>Clean machined parts individually to avoid damage due to "bumping" together. Use clean solvent to wash
                parts. Dry parts with compressed air. Nicks or burrs must be removed with a fine hand stone before
                assembly. Use only clean motor oil to coat parts to ease assembly.

            <para>All O-rings, seals and gaskets should be replaced as a part of any repair.</para>
            <para>All hoses, lines and the reservoir and filter should be cleaned before re-installing repaired steering
                gear.
