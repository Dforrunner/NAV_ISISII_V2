        <title>ROTARY CONTROL VALVE</title>
        <para>The rotary control valve combines simplicity of construction with desirable performance characteristics.
            The speed at which the driver can turn the steering wheel with power assist is dependent upon the pump flow
            (measured in gallons per minute or liters per minute) directed to a cylinder cavity. The control valve
            controls flow through the steering gear.
        </para>
        <para>The pressure (measured in pounds per square inch, or bar) required for the gear to steer the vehicle is
            created by the power steering pump to overcome resistance at the steered wheels. The control valve senses
            these requirements and directs fluid to the appropriate cylinder cavity in the steering gear (and in the
            auxiliary cylinder if it is a dual steering system) at the proper flow rate and pressure.
