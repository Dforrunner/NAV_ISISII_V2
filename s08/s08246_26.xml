        <title>HYDRAULIC RETARDER</title>
        <para>When the retarder request switch (917) is moved to the on position, a ground path is applied to the ECM
            (379) by circuit 24, connector (3), circuit 24, connector (377-A), and circuit 24 to a splice at connector
            (377-B), circuit 24V, the closed contacts of switch (917), circuit 92-G, a splice, circuit 92-GY, a splice
            at connector (377-B), circuit 94GC, connector (377-A), and circuits 94-GC and 11-G to cab ground.
        </para>
        <para>The ECM will then switch pin 47 low when the cruise is off and the throttle pedal is in the idle position,
            or when cruise control is on and the brake pedal is depressed. This will allow power to flow through fuse
            F4, circuit 97K, connector (3), circuits 97K and 24B, connector (372), circuit 24B, connector (789), circuit
            24B, the coil of retarder enable relay (790), circuit 24A, connector (789), circuit 24A, connector (372),
            and circuit 24A.
        </para>
        <para>This will energize relay (790), its contacts will close, and a ground path will be provided to the ECU
            (634)/pin 27 through circuit 163, the normally open relay contacts, circuit 161D, and circuit 161 from the
            ECU signal ground at (632)/pin 31.
        </para>
        <para>When the brake pedal is depressed, power flows through fuse F9, circuit 70, connector (46), circuits 70
            and 70R, stop light switch and connector (70), circuits 70A and 70N, connector (499), and circuit 70N to the
            brake light relay (792) normally open contacts. Power also flows from circuit 70 through circuit 70Z, stop
            light switch and connector (71) and circuit 70W to feed circuit 70N. By circuit 70N, power is also fed to
            circuit 70Y and the brake status relay (923). This energizes the relay which is grounded through circuits
            70-G and 70-GA to ECM ground.
        </para>
        <para>With relay (923) energized, a ground path is applied to pin 29 of the Allison ECU (632) by circuit 137,
            the normally open contacts of relay (923), and circuits 161E and 161 to signal ground pin 31 of Allison ECU
            (632). This tells the ECU that the service brakes are applied and the ECU will switch pin 18 of connector
            (632) high if the retarder request switch is in the on position. With (632)/pin 18 switched high, power will
            stop flowing through circuit 146H [from power feed of relay (790)] to the coil of the retarder on warning
            light relay, and circuit 125 back to (632)/pin 18. This will de-energize relay (791) and allow power to
            flow, from the power feed side of the relay coil, through jumper circuit 146F, the normally closed relay
            contacts to two locations. Power will flow through circuit 92J to energize the service brake light relay
            (792), which is grounded through circuit 70-GA to ECU ground, if it is not already energized by the brake
            light switch circuit. Thus allowing power to flow through fuse F9, circuit 70, connector (46), circuits 70
            and 70P, connector (499), circuit 70P, the normally open contacts, circuit 70N, connector (499), and
            circuits 70N and 70V to connector (46) and the stop light circuits, causing the stop lights to illuminate.
        </para>
        <para>Power will also flow through circuit 92H, connector (499), circuit 105, connector (925), and circuit 105
            to the "retarder on" warning light. This will cause the warning light, which is grounded through circuit
            92-GZ, connector (926), circuits 92-GZ, 92-GY and 94-GC, connector (377-A), and circuits 94-GC and 11-G to
            cab ground, to illuminate.
        </para>
        <para>If the retarder reaches a temperature of 330&#176;F, or above, after extended periods of operation, the
            Allison ECU will switch pin 19 of connector (632) low. This will illuminate the retarder overtemp warning
            light by allowing power to flow through key switch (24), circuit 13J, connector (377-A), circuit 13J, a
            splice at connector (377-B), circuit 13Z, connector (925), circuit 132, and the "retarder overtemp" warning
            light. Power will then flow through circuit 105, connector (925), circuit 105, connector (499), and circuit
            105 to pin 19 of ECU connector (632).
