        <title>ENGINE OIL PRESSURE GAUGE, LIGHT, AND ALARM</title>
        <svcprocinfo>
            <para>The input signal to the Speedo/Tach module for the engine oil pressure gauge (and warning light and
                alarm) comes from a gauge sender with mechanical engines or the ECM with electronic engines.
            </para>
        </svcprocinfo>
        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Electronic Engines</title>
            <para>The Caterpillar, Cummins and Detroit Diesel electronic control systems include a sensor to determine
                engine oil pressure, so the information is in the ECM.
            </para>
            <para>The ECM sends a signal in the form of a serial data transmission over the ATA data link circuit (a
                positive and negative pair of twisted wires) to the Speedo/Tach module through connector (421). The
                signal is also present at the ATA data link connector and oil pressure can be read using an electronic
                service tool (EST).
            </para>
            <para>For additional information on the data link refer to GROUP 08, Electronic Engine Controls, in the
                CTS-5000 Master Service Manual.
            </para>

        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Mechanical Engines</title>
            <para>With mechanical engines, a 3-wire oil pressure sender (565) is installed on the engine. Circuit 35A
                supplies 4.4 volts from the Speedo/Tach module to the sender at the red wire. The sender is grounded
                from the black wire on circuit 35-G to the Speedo/Tach module. The sender returns a variable signal (0.5
                volt minimum) to the Speedo/Tach module on circuit 35.
            </para>
        </svcsubproc>
        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Oil Pressure Gauge</title>
            <para>The Speedo/Tach module processes the signal from the sender and outputs signals to drive the gauge
                through connector (422) on circuits 35S(+), 35S(-), 35C(+) and 35C(-) to the left gauge cluster at
                connector (424). The oil pressure gauge is a 4-pin electronically driven gauge that plugs into the gauge
                cluster.
            </para>
        </svcsubproc>
        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Warning Light</title>
            <para>The oil pressure warning light should turn ON and remain on as a bulb test, while the gauges go
                through the self test process with key ON and engine OFF.
            </para>
            <para>The low oil pressure warning light in the left gauge cluster receives ignition voltage (key ON)
                through cluster connector (423) from 10A fuse F4-A. The warning light ground path is through cluster
                connector (423) on circuit 35L to the Speedo/Tach module connector (422). In response to sensor or ECM
                inputs indicating low oil pressure, the module opens and closes a ground switch causing the light to
                turn ON or OFF.
            </para>
        </svcsubproc>
        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Alarm</title>
            <para>In response to sensor or ECM inputs indicating low oil pressure, the Speedo/Tach module causes the
                alarm to sound. The alarm will sound five short beeps when the low oil light turns ON. The alarm is an
                internal feature of the Speedo/Tach module.
            </para>
        </svcsubproc>
        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Alarm And Warning Light Trip Points</title>
            <para>The Speedo/Tach module reports low oil pressure (alarm and warning light) differently with electronic
                engines than with mechanical engines. With the electronic engines, the low oil pressure signal comes
                from the engine ECM over the data link. The low oil pressure alarm and warning lights are turned ON and
                OFF by diagnostic messages provided by the Caterpillar, Cummins or Detroit Diesel ECM (engine
                controller).
            </para>
            <para>With mechanical engines and standard sensors, the trip point for the low oil pressure alarm and
                warning light is programmed in the Speedo/Tach module by International.
