            <title>Left Side Power Window and Lock</title>
            <para>The switch data link is connected to left side pod signal connector (3209) terminal C and D. The
                circuit path from ESC connector (1600) is on twisted pair A3F(-)/A3E(+), to circuits A3Z(-)/A3Y(+),
                through roof/IP connector (2600) terminals E and B, to circuits D3Z(-)/D3Y(+) and D3AA(-)/D3B(+),
                through left crew door pod connector (2601) terminals B and A, to circuits T3AA(-) and T3BB(+).
            </para>
            <para>Battery voltage to the left side pod signal connector (3209) terminal G is provided from fuse block
                (1014), F37. The circuit path from the fuse block is circuit A81C, through roof/IP connector (2600)
                terminal A, circuit D81C, through door connector (2601) terminal C, and circuit T81E.
            </para>
            <para>System ground to the left side pod signal connector (3209) terminal E is provided from negative stud
                (1858). The circuit path from the negative stud is circuit A11-GH, A81-GC, through roof/IP connector
                (2600) terminal F, circuits D81-GC and D81-GF through left crew door pod connector (2601) terminal D,
                and circuit T81-GD.
            </para>
            <para>Ground is also supplied to (3209) terminal B on circuit T8B from circuit D81-GG through (2601)
                terminal F. This sets the addressing for the pod so it identifies itself, to the ESC, as the left crew
                door pod.
            </para>
            <para>Control voltage to left window motor (3002) terminals A and B is supplied from left pod load connector
                (3210) terminals B and A on circuits T83C and T83F.
            </para>
            <para>Control voltage to left power door lock (3211) terminals A and B is supplied from pod load connector
                (3210) terminals C and D on circuits T81C and T81F.
            </para>
            <para>Pressing the door power window button will cause the pod to apply voltage to the power window motor.
            </para>
            <para>Pressing the power lock button will cause the pod to apply voltage to the power lock motor in the left
                door. The pod will also sends a message on the switch data link commanding the pods in the other door(s)
                with power locks to apply voltage to their lock motor.
            </para>

            <title>Right Side Power Window and Lock</title>
            <para>The switch data link is connected to right side pod signal connector (3209) terminal C and D. The
                circuit path from ESC connector (1600) is on twisted pair A3F(-)/A3E(+), to circuits A3Z(-)/A3Y(+),
                through roof/IP connector (2600) terminals E and B, to circuits D3Z(-)/D3Y(+) and D3CC(-)/D3BB(+),
                through right crew door pod connector (2602) terminals B and A, to circuits T3AA(-) and T3BB(+).
            </para>
            <para>Battery voltage to the right side pod signal connector (3209) terminal G is provided from fuse block
                (1014), F43. The circuit path from the fuse block is circuit A81D, through roof/IP connector (2600)
                terminal C, circuit D81D, through door connector (2602) terminal C, and circuit T81E.
            </para>
            <para>System ground to the right side pod signal connector (3209) terminal E is provided from negative stud
                (1858). The circuit path from the negative stud is circuit A11-GH, A81-GB, through roof/IP connector
                (2600) terminal D, circuits D81-GB and D81-GD through right crew door pod connector (2602) terminal D,
                and circuit T81-GD.
            </para>
            <para>Ground is also supplied to (3209) terminal A on circuit T8A from circuit D81-GE through (2602)
                terminal E. This sets the addressing for the pod so it identifies itself, to the ESC, as the right crew
                door pod.
            </para>
            <para>Control voltage to right window motor (3002) terminals B and A is supplied from right pod load
                connector (3210) terminals A and B on circuits T83F and T83C.
            </para>
            <para>Control voltage to right power door lock (3211) terminals A and B is supplied from pod load connector

            </para>
            <para>Pressing the door power window button will cause the pod to apply voltage to the power window motor.
            </para>
            <para>Pressing the power lock button will cause the pod to apply voltage to the power lock motor in the
                right door. The pod will also sends a message on the switch data link commanding the pods in the other
                door(s) with power locks to apply voltage to their lock motor.
