        <title>Cab and Trailer Light Switch and Relay Wiring</title>
        <para>When the headlight switch is in the on or in the parking light position, power flows through circuit 58E
            and cab and trailer lights switch (466) unless the cab and trailer lights switch is held open. After flowing
            through the switch, power flows through 58C, trailer marker lights relay (463-R8) and 58P to cab and trailer
            light relay (464-R9). The trailer marker light relay then becomes energized as the power flows through it to
            the ground circuits 58-GA and 11-G. This allows power to flow through circuits 14H, 14E, fuse F3-A, circuit
            58D, trailer marker lights relay, and through circuits 58R, and 58S to the trailer socket (112). Likewise
            the cab and trailer tail light relay becomes energized as the power flows from the cab and trailer light
            switch and through the relay coil and ground circuit 58-G. This allows power to flow through circuits 14H,
            14B, fuse F3-C, circuit 68, through cab and trailer tail light relay, and through circuit 68E. From this
            point it flows through circuit 68B to the trailer socket. It also flows through circuit 68D, fuse F8-C, and
            circuit 68C to supply mirror lights, tail lights, clearance lights, panel lights, and park lights.
