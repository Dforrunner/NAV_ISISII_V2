        <title>Stop Light Switch, Truck Or Truck With Chassis Hand Control, With Air Brakes and International Engine
        </title>
        <para>Power is applied from battery feed block (J1) to circuit 14A, fuse F9, circuit 70, connector (46) and a
            red wire to the stop light switch (70). From stop light switch (70), power is also supplied through a red
            wire to the stop light switch (71). Applying the brakes closes the switch contacts and power flows through
            the switches and a brown wire to connector (46).
        </para>
        <para>From connector (46), power flows through circuit 70DS to a splice. From the splice, a voltage signal is
            applied to ECM (379) through circuits 97M and 97N and dash connector (3). This signals the ECM that the
            brakes have been applied. The ECM uses this information to control various operations of the vehicle such as
            cruise and PTO controls, etc.
        </para>
        <para>From the splice, power also flows through circuit 70E to the stop light relay (660). The relay coil is
            grounded through circuit 97-GH/11-GN to cab ground. This energizes the relay.
        </para>
        <para>Voltage is also applied from fuse F9 through circuit 70A to the stop light relay (660). With the relay
            energized, power is supplied through the relay switch contacts and circuit 70B to the turn signal switch
            (459).
        </para>
        <para>With an International turn signal, power for the left stop light is applied through turn signal switch
            (495), circuit 56D/56DS, junction block connector (182) and circuit 56F to dash connector (13). Power for
            the right stop light is applied through circuit 57D/57DS, junction block connector (182) and circuit 57F to
            dash connector (13). From the dash connector power is supplied to the left rear stop light through a yellow
            wire and to the right rear stop light through a green wire. The stop/tail lights are grounded through a
            white wire to the frame.
