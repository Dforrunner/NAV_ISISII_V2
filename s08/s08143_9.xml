            <para>All CELECT vehicles have a yellow "Engine Warning" light and a red "Engine Stop" light located in the
                telltale lights in the instrument cluster. Every time the key is turned to the ignition position, the
                lights come on for several seconds as a system self-test and then turn off.
            </para>
            <para>If the warning lights remain on, it is an indication that the ECM has detected a problem. The CELECT
                system can show and record certain problems. The problems are shown as fault codes. The fault codes are
                recorded in the ECM.
