        <para>Power is continuously supplied to B1 battery adapter, circuits 14K and 14AM, 15A fuse F5-C, circuit 88B,
            connector (20), and the yellow wire to the radio, thus providing continuous power to maintain the clock and
            station memory programming. A ground circuit is provided through the black wire, connector (21), and
            circuits 86-GB and 11-GLB to panel ground adapter L4 (587). When the key switch (452) is in the ignition or
            accessories position, power is supplied to circuit 12M, 10A fuse F5-B, circuit 86, connector (20), and a red
            wire to the radio, thus providing power to the radio/cassette player.

        <para>A signal path is provided through a white wire connector (20), circuit 86A, connector (739), circuit 86A,
            connector (52), and the green wire to the left front speaker. The return path is through a black wire,
            connector (52), circuit 86B, connector (739), circuit 86B, connector (20), and the white/black wire to the
            radio.

        <para>A signal path is provided through a gray wire connector (20), circuit 86C, connector (739), circuit 86C,
            connector (18), and the green wire to the right front speaker. The return path is through a black wire,
            connector (18), circuit 86D, connector (739), circuit 86D, connector (20), and the gray/black wire to the
            radio.
