        <title>Heated Fuel Filter With Water-In-Fuel Light, Fuel Filter Restriction Light</title>
        <para>The fuel filter heater is mounted in the fuel filter and when operating, it helps prevent fuel from
            gelling up in the unfiltered side of the filter. The system consists of a fuel heater relay, the filter
            heating element and a normally open thermo switch. The switch contacts close at approximately 10&#176;C (50&#176;F).
        </para>
        <para>The water-in-fuel system consists of a control module, a water probe, and a warning light in the dash
            cluster. When water is present in the fuel filter, increased current will flow from the probe to ground. The
            module senses this increase and turns on the warning light. The system also conducts a bulb check when the
            key switch is in the start position to verify the light operates.
        </para>
        <para>The fuel filter restriction light is activated when the fuel filter becomes restricted. This causes the
            fuel filter vacuum switch contacts to close and activates the light.
