            <emph type="bold">Right Motorized Mirror -</emph>The right motorized mirror switch (437) receives power from
            ignition relay (462-R1), through 10A fuse F5-A, when the key is in the on or accessory position. Momentarily
            positioning the switch down from the neutral position closes the circuit between switch contacts 1 - 2 and 4
            - 5. This applies voltage to the motor on circuit 78F and grounds the motor through 78E. Momentarily
            positioning the switch up from the neutral position closes the circuit between switch contacts 2-3 and 5-6.
            This applies voltage to the motor on circuit 78E and grounds the motor through 78F.

            <emph type="bold">Dual Axis Motorized Mirrors -</emph>
            The dual axis motorized mirror switch 1137 receives power from ignition relay (462-R1), through 10A fuse
            F5-A, on circuit 78C, through connector (1137), when the key is in the on or accessory position. Twisting
            the mirror control switch knob selects which mirror will be controlled. Positioning the L/R switch to the
            Left or Right position will cause the controlled mirror to move to the Left or Right. Positioning the U/D
            switch to the Up or Down position will cause the controlled mirror to move Up or Down. Ground for the
            circuits is supplied from GND Adapter (456) on circuit 78-GA through connector (1137).

        <para>Use the DUAL AXIS MOTORIZED MIRROR circuit diagrams in CTS-5298 or S08225 to determine which circuits are
            energized to move the mirrors.
