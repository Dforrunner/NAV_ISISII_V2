        <para>International circuits use
            <emph type="bold">suppressed</emph>Hella relays for controlling power to load devices. The suppression
            feature (a resistor circuit parallel to the relay coil) prevents voltage spikes from damaging electronic
            components in the vehicle.
            <emph type="bold">These relays must be replaced with the correct International part.</emph>
        </para>
        <para>Relays used in exposed areas such as the engine compartment are sealed relays and are a different part
            number than those in the cab. The part number is embossed on the relay. There is also a circuit diagram of
            the relay located on the relay body. The terminals are numbered on the relay in the same manner as in the
            circuit diagrams. To test the relay, refer to
