        <para>With key off.</para>
        <para>Since no power is applied to the key off relay, the normally closed relay will supply power to the lift
            door power relay. When the wheelchair lift door is opened, the lift door proximity switch will apply a
            ground signal to the lift door relay allow the wheelchair lift to operate.

        <para>With key on.</para>
        <para>When the wheelchair lift door is opened, the lift door proximity switch will close supplying a ground to
            the wheelchair lift relay (1019). This will cause the wheelchair lift relay to energize and supply the zero
            volt signal to ESC (1600). The ESC (1600) will then supply a ground signal on pin 23. This will allow the
            key on relay to energize as long as the follow conditions are met:
