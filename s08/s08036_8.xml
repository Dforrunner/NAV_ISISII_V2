        <title>MOTOR</title>
        <para>If the battery, wiring and switches are in satisfactory condition, and the engine is known to be
            functioning properly, remove the motor and follow the test procedures outlined below.
        </para>
        <para>A cranking motor is designed for intermittent duty only, and should never be operated for more than 30
            seconds at a time. After 30 seconds, the cranking must be stopped for at least two minutes to allow the
            motor to cool. The same rule applies to a motor with a thermostat. The thermostat is an added protection
            against damage from overcranking.
        </para>
        <para>With the cranking motor removed from the engine, the armature should be checked for freedom of rotation by
            prying the pinion with a screwdriver. Tight bearings, a bent armature shaft, or a loose pole shoe will
            prevent the armature from turning freely. If the armature does not turn freely the motor should be
            disassembled for repairs. However, if the armature does rotate freely, the motor should be given a no-load
            test before disassembly.
