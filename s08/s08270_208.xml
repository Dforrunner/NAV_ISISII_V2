        <para>(B2) battery stud supplies power to circuits 14H and 14E, 20A fuse F3-B, circuits 70 and 70F, and stop
            light switch (421). When the service brakes are applied, the contacts of switch (421) close and power flows
            through circuit 70B to the trailer stop light relay (464-R10) and circuit 70A to the turn signal switch
            connector (36). Thus with the turn signal switch in its neutral position, power flows through the red wire,
            switch contacts, yellow wire, circuit 56B, connector (125), and circuit 56B to left rear tractor stop lamp.
            The left lamp is grounded through connector (4) and a white wire to frame ground. Thus with the turn signal
            switch in its neutral position, power also flows through the green wire, circuit 57B, connector (125),
            circuit 57B, connector (4), internal jumper, connector (4A), a green wire, and connector (3) to right rear
            tractor stop lamp. The right lamp is grounded through connector (3), a white wire, connector (4A), an
            internal jumper, connector (4) and a white wire to frame ground.
        </para>
        <para>When the headlight switch (410) is in the headlight or park light position, power is fed by circuit 58E to
            the N.C. contacts of trailer lights switch (409), to circuit 58P, and the coil of trailer tail light relay
            (464-R9). This energizes the relay which is grounded through circuits 58-G, 70-G, 56-G, 11-GZ, and 11-GI to
            left cab ground (429). With the relay energized, power flows from battery stud (B2) through circuits 14W and
            14B, 30A fuse F3-C, circuit 68, N.O. relay contacts, circuits 68E and 68B, 15A fuse F8-C, circuits 68C and
            68D, connector (125), and circuit 68D to the left tractor tail light, and connector (4A), the brown wire and
            right tractor tail light connector (3). The left tail light is grounded through connector (4) and the white
            wire to frame ground. The right tail light is grounded through connector (3), the white wire, connectors
            (4A) and (4), and the white wire to frame ground.
        </para>
        <para>With turn signal switch (36) in the left turn position, power flows from battery stud (B1) through
            circuits 14K and 14R, 20A fuse F2-D, circuit 55, flasher (501), and circuit 55A to the turn signal switch
            (36) black wire. Power will flow through the closed contacts and orange wire of switch (36), and circuit 56A
            to the left turn relay, and through switch (36) and circuit 56E to the left front turn lights. Power will
            also flow through the yellow wire of switch (36), and circuit 56B, connector (125), and circuit 56B to the
            left rear tractor turn light. With turn signal switch (36) in the right turn position, power will flow
            through the closed contacts and the blue wire of switch (36), and circuit 57A to the right turn relay, and
            through switch (36) and circuit 57E to the right front turn lights. Power will also flow through the green
            wire of switch (36), and circuit 57B, connector (125), circuit 57B to the left rear tractor light connectors
            (4) and (4A), and a green wire to the right rear tractor turn light (3).
        </para>
        <para>The hazard lights system functions by the turn signal switch selecting both the left and right turn signal
            circuits at the same time.
