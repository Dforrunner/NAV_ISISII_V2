            <title>Without Kysor Engine Shutdown</title>
            <para>The PT Pacer Control Unit (PCU) harness is connected to the fuel shutoff solenoid terminal, which
                receives ignition power from fuse F4 (20 AMP).

            <title>With Kysor Engine Shutdown</title>
            <para>During the 30-second start period, the Kysor Control Module controls delivery of ignition voltage to
                the PCU and the fuel shutoff solenoid.
            </para>
            <step1>
                <para count="1">When the key switch is turned to the ON position, ignition power (circuit 19A) is
                    delivered to the Kysor Control Module at terminal 1.
                </para>
            </step1>
            <step1>
                <para count="1">When the starter is engaged (with key or starter button), circuit 19B delivers power to
                    the Kysor Control Module (terminal 2) and the 30-second delay is activated, closing the switch
                    between terminals 1 and 3. With the Kysor Control Module switch between terminals 1 and 3 closed,
                    current is delivered on circuit 19M, to activate the Kysor relay. With the relay activated, ignition
                    power is delivered (circuit 19D) to the fuel shutoff solenoid and to the PT Pacer Control Module.
                </para>
                <para>After the 30-second start interval, the Kysor Control Module switch (between terminals 1 &#38; 3)
                    opens and the ignition power source to the PCU and fuel shutoff solenoid from the Kysor relay is cut
                    off.
                </para>
            </step1>
            <step1>
                <para count="1">Normally, within the 30-second time delay when the power to the fuel solenoid is
                    controlled by the Kysor Control Module, the engine will have more than five PSI of oil pressure and
                    control will be turned over to the alarmstat and pressurestat control system. Circuit 19H from the
                    alarmstat supplies the voltage to the fuel shutoff solenoid after the 30-second delay period has
                    ended and sufficient oil pressure is available to close the NO (normally open) contact in the
                    pressurestat.
                </para>
            </step1>
            <para>In the event of low oil pressure (less than 5 PSI) or high engine coolant temperatures (higher than
                225 degrees F), the power to the fuel shutoff solenoid is cut off, which will shut down the engine to
                prevent engine damage.
