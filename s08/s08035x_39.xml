        <title>SENSOR FAULT DIAGNOSTICS</title>

            <para>With electronic or mechanical engines, electronic gauge sensor faults are reported by steering the
                gauge pointer to the 6 o'clock position and the alarm sounding three long beeps.

        <svcsubproc>
            <title>With Electronic Engines</title>
            <para>The related gauge will go to the 6 o'clock position and the alarm will sound three long beeps based on
                diagnostic messages from the Caterpillar, Cummins or Detroit Diesel ECM. The software capabilities of
                these three manufacturers are not the same, so not all defects will be reported. The Pro-Link 9000 or
                EZ-Tech ESTs can be used to check for engine fault codes that relate to sensor defects.
            </para>
            <para>Additionally, the Pro-Link 9000 EST or EZ-Tech can be used to monitor engine oil pressure, water
                temperature, vehicle speed and engine rpm from data link connector (137). This is the same signal sent
                to the Speedo/Tach module, only accessed at a different connector.
            </para>
            <para>An open fuel sender or open fuel sender circuit (ground or signal circuit) will cause three long beeps
                and the gauge will go to 6 o'clock. Note that a shorted fuel sender or sender circuit would cause the
                gauge to read empty all of the time.

            <para>Not all fault conditions will be reported due to sensor characteristics. The related gauge will go to
                the 6 o'clock position and the alarm will sound three long beeps for:
