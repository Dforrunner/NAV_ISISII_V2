            <para>This section describes the electrical operation of the International circuits and components used to
                connect the transmission to the vehicle electrical system and to the various International installed
                controls.

                    the 2000, 4000, and 8000 models.</emph>The other models included in this section, the 1000, 3600,
                3800 and 4000FBC operate in the same manner, but harness configuration is different and some connector
                and circuit numbers are different.

            <title>WTEC III ELECTRONIC CONTROL SYSTEM POWER SOURCE</title>
            <para>The WTEC III electronic control system receives battery power at all times and ignition power when the
                key is on.
            </para>
            <para>BATTERY POWER - Direct battery power from the B+ terminal flows through circuit 14A, 40A MEGA FUSE,
                circuit 14B, connector (412A), circuit 14B, connector (426), circuits 14B and A336, connector (807),
                circuit A336, connector (13), circuit 136A, 10A fuse (301), circuit 136, connector (418), and circuit
                136B and 136A to ECU connector (632).
            </para>
            <para>IGNITION POWER - With the key switch in start or ignition position, power from the key switch (24)
                flows through circuit 13J, connector (377), circuit 13M, fuse (301), circuit 146, connector (418) and
                circuit 146 to a splice. From the splice, power flows through circuit 146C to the backup light relay
                (639) coil, through circuit 146A to the ECU (634), and through circuit 146E to the neutral indicator
                relay (962).
            </para>
            <para>The ignition voltage acts as an On/Off switch for the WTEC III ECU and provides ignition power to
                selected relays located in the rear of the cab.
