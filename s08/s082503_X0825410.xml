        <title>GAUGE SWEEP</title>
        <para>After the ignition is turned on, a gauge sweep of the EGC and AGSP will be performed. Each gauge must
            sweep from zero to maximum to zero in unison. All of the gauge warning lights will illuminate along with the
            panel warning lights that are applicable to features installed on the vehicle. The yellow and red "ENGINE"
            warning lamps should also illuminate (they are turned on by the engine controller not the gauge cluster
            test). The alarms associated with each gauge warning light do not sound. All of the segments of the EGC LCD
            should display while the gauges sweep. At the end of the sweep the LCD will turn off all segments for .5
            seconds, display the firmware version number, then return to operational mode. The lights controlled by the
            panel dimmer in the EGC will also come on during the gauge sweep.
        </para>
        <para>A gauge that points between the 9 and 10 o'clock position is most likely connected to the wrong location
            on the circuit board inside the EGC.
        </para>
        <para>If the instrument cluster or any of the remote modules experience a system fault, they will transmit a
            fault message to the ESC.
