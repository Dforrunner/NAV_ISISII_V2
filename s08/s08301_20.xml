            <para>If the speedometer, odometer, voltmeter, oil pressure, or water temperature gauge indicates a failure,
                the circuits serving the instrument in question must be checked for clean, tight, unbroken and
                non-shorted connections.

            <para>The self testing diagnostics provide a strong indication of what is wrong with the unit. This reduces
                the need to remove the cluster from the vehicle and cuts down on troubleshooting time.

            <title>Pass Indications</title>
            <para>The cluster will test itself each time the vehicle is powered up. If all tests pass, the unit will
                drive the voltmeter, oil pressure gauge, and water temperature gauge needles through a full sweep. The
                speedometer needle will be driven through a 45 degree sweep. And the parking brake, water-in-fuel, and
                the fuel filter lights will come on for approximately 6 seconds. These tests indicate that the gauges
                and lights are in working order. If the odometer display does not display an error code and the
                speedometer does not point down, then the data link is present from the ECM. Other indicator lights will
                light when the vehicle is powered up. These lights are tested by the devices which drive the particular
                indicators.
