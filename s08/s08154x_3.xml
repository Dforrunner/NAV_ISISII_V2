            <para>The electronic speedometer, odometer, tachometer and hourmeter are microprocessor driven gauges. The
                microprocessor is programmable to be compatible with different tire sizes, axle ratios, and a variety of
                engines. The gauges are located in the instrument panel gauge cluster and can be quickly detached from
                the instrument panel for quick access to any of its components. Refer to

            <para>The electronic speedometer, odometer, tachometer and hourmeter are microprocessor driven gauges. The
                microprocessor is factory programmed to operate from data link signals generated by the engine
