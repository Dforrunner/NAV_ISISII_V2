        <title>ANTILOCK BRAKE INTERFACE</title>
        <para>On vehicles with both the Bendix Antilock Brake System (ABS) and the Allison WTEC III transmission,
            circuit 94J and a torque converter lock-up drop relay (570) link the ABS ECU with the WTEC III ECU.
        </para>
        <para>The torque converter lock-up drop relay (570) has 12 volt power fed to its coil from fuse (301), and
            circuits 13K, 13L, and 94F. The relay also has a ground path applied to its normally open contact by way of
            circuit 161A, connector (418), and circuits 161A and 161 going to the Allison ECU "V" connector (632) signal
            ground pin 31.
        </para>
        <para>Under normal vehicle operation the ABS controller (288) does not have its pin K1 switched to ground and
            the WTEC III ECU is permitted to allow the transmission retarder to function and torque converter to
            lock-up.
        </para>
        <para>If the ABS controller (288) senses an impending wheel lock-up condition, it will modulate the air brakes
            (to prevent wheel lock-up), and it will switch its pin K1 low (to ground). This allows power to flow through
            the coil of the torque converter drop relay (570), circuit 94J, connector (13), and a yellow wire to pin K1.
            This energizes relay (570) and applies a ground path to the Allison ECU "V" connector (632)/pin 27 by way of
            circuit 154A, connector (418), and circuit 154E to pin 30 of relay (570). This will cause the WTEC III ECU
            to disengage the torque converter lock-up clutch and the engine brake if so equipped.
