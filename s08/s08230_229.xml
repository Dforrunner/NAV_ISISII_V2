        <title>Clearance, Marker and Tail Lights With Tractor or Truck and Without International Engine</title>
        <para>Battery power is applied to junction block (J1), circuit 14E, fuse F24 and circuit 50A to headlight switch
            (35). When the headlight switch is moved to the park light or headlight position, power flows through
            circuit 62 to the panel light dimmer control and circuit 58A to energize relay (R2). The ground path, for
            (R2) without an interrupter switch, is through circuit 58-GA, connector (202), and a white wire to cab
            ground. The ground path with interrupt switch (32) is through circuit 58-G, interrupt switch (32), circuit
            58-GB, and circuit 11-GA/11-GF to cab ground.
        </para>
        <para>When relay (R2) is energized, power flows from junction block (J1), circuit 14A, fuse F8, circuit 58,
            relay (R2), and circuit 58B to a splice. From the splice, power flows through circuit 58D, connector (2),
            circuit 58D, circuit 58E, the left marker/turn light (503), and ground circuits 11-GD, 11-GC (with and
            without USA DRL), 11-GB, connector (2), and circuit 11-GB to cab ground. Power also flows through circuit
            58D and 58F to the right marker/turn light (505) and ground circuits 11-GF, 11-GE, 11-GB, connector (2) and
            circuit 11-GB to cab ground.
        </para>
        <para>With Canadian DRL, the ground circuit for the left marker light is 11-GD, 11-GB, connector (2) and 11-GB
            to cab ground, and for the right marker light, ground circuit is 11-GF, 11-GE, 11-GB, connector (2) and
            11-GB to cab ground.
        </para>
        <para>With additional pedestal marker/turn lights, power also flows from the splice through circuit 58D,
            connector (2), circuit 58D, and circuit 58H to the left pedestal marker/turn light and circuit 58J to the
            right pedestal marker/turn light. Ground circuit is 11-GG and 11-GB to cab ground for the left light and
            11-GH and 11-GB to cab ground for the right light.
        </para>
        <para>From the splice, power is also fed to connector (13) for trailer marker lights over circuit 58E, connector
            (183) and circuit 58E.
        </para>
        <para>Power flowing from circuit 58B and the splice also flows through circuit 68, connector (13), and a brown
            wire to the left tail light and a brown wire to the right tail light. Both lights are grounded through white
            wires to frame ground.
        </para>
        <para>With frame mounted 7-way trailer socket or owner/operator package, power flowing from circuit 58B and the
            splice also flows to circuit 68C and to the trailer connector junction block (182).
        </para>
        <para>With tractors only, power flowing from circuit 58B and the splice also flows to circuit 68A and 68B to the
            trailer cable connector (78).
        </para>
        <para>Power flowing from circuit 58B and the splice also flows through circuit 58C, connector (19), circuit 58C,
            connector (15), and circuits 58C, 58C1, 58C2, 58C3, and 58C4 to the cab clearance and marker lights. The
            ground path is circuits 58-GC1, 58-GC2, 58-GC3, 58-GC4, and 58-GC, connector (15), circuit 58-GC, connector
            (19), circuit 58-GC, and 11-G to cab ground.
