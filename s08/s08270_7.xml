        <title>GROUND ADAPTERS</title>
        <para>A ground cable from the vehicle batteries is attached to a ground stud (G) at the rear of the cranking
            motor. From this ground stud a ground circuit 2-G is attached to the ground stud (G) at the rear of the
            alternator. Circuit 11-GX provides a ground path to the alternator ground stud (G) for the right cab ground
            stud (404). A ground path is provided to right cab ground stud (404) by circuits: 11-GA and 11-G for the G1
            ground adapter (454), 11-GAR and 11-GB for the G2 ground adapter (455), 11-GC and 11-GB for the G3 ground
            adapter (456), and 75-G and 11-G for the heater control panel.
        </para>
        <para>The left cab ground stud (429) is not directly connected to the right cab ground stud (404), but instead
            relies on the aluminum cab panels to conduct and provide a ground path. A ground path is provided to the
            left ground stud (429) by circuits: 11-GE for the G6 ground adapter (616), 11-GH and 11-GF for the G5 ground
            adapter (533), 11-GY and 11-GI for the G4 ground adapter (457).
