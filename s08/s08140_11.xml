        <title>PERFORMING A DIAGNOSTIC CHECK</title>
        <svcprocinfo>
            <para>A diagnostic check may be performed using the Diagnostic ON/OFF switch and Idle/Diagnostic INC/DEC
                switch. Any error codes will be flashed through the red and yellow warning lights. If no errors are
                found, both lights will stay on while the diagnostics switch is on. Consult the Cummins Operation and
                Maintenance Manual furnished with the vehicle for exact procedures and fault code information.
            </para>
            <para>To determine the fault codes use the following procedure:</para>

                FLASH - FLASH - FLASH. Digit number three is 3. Yellow engine warning lamp flashes once. The fault code
                is 123.

            <title>Compulink&#8482;</title>
            <para>CELECT vehicles have a data link for the Compulink. The Compulink is used to program owner-specified
                information into the engine, monitor the system, and aid in troubleshooting the engine. Consult the
                Cummins CELECT Troubleshooting and Repair Manual. The CompulinkTM may be available at the nearest
                Cummins Authorized Service Center.
            </para>
            <para>CompulinkTM must be used with a CELECT service cartridge to communicate with a CELECT engine. A PACE
                or PT PACER cartridge will not work properly.

            <para>The PRO-LINK 9000 DDR with the Heavy Duty Standard cartridge can also be used with the International
                Data Link to read active and inactive fault codes through the data link. The use of the DDR or specific
                codes are not discussed in this manual as the information is part of the Pro-Link documentation.
            </para>
            <para>The Pro-Link can also be used to monitor operation of various switches and controls and perform other
                diagnostic tasks. The specific capabilities and operating instructions are included in the Pro-Link
                documentation for the DDR and the cartridge.
