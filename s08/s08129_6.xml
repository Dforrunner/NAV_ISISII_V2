            <title>Jacobs Engine Brake</title>
            <para>The Jacobs engine brake for the 1991 Caterpillar 3176 engine is controlled by the ECM and by the
                Engine Brake Enable Relay located in the right instrument panel.

            <title>Engine Brake Enable Relay (239)</title>
            <para>Battery power to activate the engine brake solenoids is supplied from the Run Relay through fuse G1
                (15 amp) to the Engine Brake Enable Relay on circuit 24A. The power is then delivered to the Engine
                Brake On/Off switch on circuit 24B (only when the engine brake enable relay is activated).
            </para>
            <para>The engine brake enable relay control coil receives 12V power from the ECM on circuit 24Z. When the
                Engine Brake On/Off switch is closed, the ground circuit for the relay control coil is grounded at the
                cylinder head ground bolt and the engine brake enable relay is activated.
            </para>
        </svcsubproc>
        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Engine Brake On/Off Switch (188)</title>
            <para>The Engine Brake On/Off Switch is a 2-pole, single-throw switch. With the switch in the ON position,
                one pole completes the ground to activate the engine brake enable relay. The other pole delivers battery
                power from the Run Relay to the engine brake solenoids.
            </para>
            <para>Operation of the engine brake is electronically linked to the vehicle service brakes when the vehicle
                is operating in the cruise control mode. The service brakes will disable the cruise control, and if the
                engine brake switch is in the ON position, the engine brake will activate. Customer specified parameters
                determine whether the engine brake will "latch" itself on after the service brakes are released or if
                the engine will "coast" when the brakes are released.
