        <title>Heater-Bunk With Standard Temperature Control</title>
        <para>When key switch (40) is moved to the ignition position, power is applied to I2 ignition adapter (495),
            circuit 13AT and the coil of auxiliary blower relay (147) through the "BUNK" switch in HVAC control (1057).
            The ground path for the auxiliary blower relay is circuits 13-GAT and 11-GBC to ground adapter (454). This
            energizes the auxiliary bunk blower relay (147) and allows power to flow from (B2) battery stud through
            circuits 14AK and 14AU, 15A fuse F10-B (location may vary), circuit 75AX, auxiliary bunk relay (147) N.O.
            contacts, circuit 75AS, connector (906), circuits 75AS and 75AR to bunk heater blower switch (593).
        </para>
        <para>When the bunk heater blower switch (593) is moved to the low speed position, power flows through circuit
            75AC, connector (49), circuit 75AC, resistor and thermofuse assembly, circuit 75AT, connect (48), circuit
            75AT, sleeper high speed relay (584) N.C. contacts, circuit 75AF, connector (48) and circuit 75AF to the
            sleeper blower motor (1053).
        </para>
        <para>This causes the blower motor to run at low speed. The blower motor ground path is circuit 75-GA, connector
            (48), circuits 75-GA, 11-GBD, and 11-GBC to ground adapter (454).
        </para>
        <para>When the bunk blower switch (593) is moved to the medium speed position, power flows through circuit 75AN
            to the sleeper medium speed relay (585). The ground path for the sleeper medium speed relay (585) is
            circuits 75-GN, 11-GBD, and 11-GBC to ground adapter (454). This energizes the sleeper medium speed relay
            (585) and allows power to flow from (B2) battery stud through circuits 14AK, 14AU, fuse F10-A (location may
            vary), circuits 75AW, 75AB, sleeper medium speed relay (585) N.O. contacts, circuit 75AM, connector (48),
            circuit 75AM, resistor and thermofuse assembly (N/L), circuit 75AT, connector (48), circuit 75AT, sleeper
            high speed relay (584) N.C. contacts, circuit 75AF, connector (48), and circuit 75AF to sleeper blower
            motor. This causes the blower motor to run at medium speed. The blower ground path is circuit 75-GA,
            connector (48), circuit 75-GA, 11-GBD, and 11-GBC to ground adapter (454).
        </para>
        <para>When the bunk blower switch (593) is moved to the high speed position, power flows through the switch,
            circuit 75AH to the sleeper high speed relay (584). The ground path for the sleeper high speed relay (584)
            is circuits 75-GH, 75-GN, 11-GBD, and 11-GBC to ground adapter (454).
        </para>
        <para>This energizes the sleeper high speed relay (584) and allows power to flow from (B2) battery stud through
            circuits 14AK and 14AU, 30A fuse F10-A (location may vary), circuit 75AW, connector (942), circuits 75AW,
            75AD, sleeper high speed relay (584) N.O. contacts, circuit 75AF, connector (48) and circuit 75AF to sleeper
            blower motor. This causes the blower motor to run at high speed.
        </para>
        <para>The blower ground path is circuit 75-GA, connector (48), circuits 75-GA, 11-GBD and 11-GBC to ground
            adapter (454).
        </para>
        <para>When the key switch (40) is moved to the ignition position and the blower switch (593) is not off, power
            is also made available by the auxiliary bunk relay (147) to circuit 75AS, connector (906), circuit 75AS,
            switch (592), and circuit 75AL to sleeper temperature control connector (592). The ground path for the
            sleeper temperature control is through connector (592), circuit 75-GS, 11-GAE to sleeper ground stud (746),
            circuit 11-GAN, connector (942) and circuit 11-GAN to B-pillar ground stud.
        </para>
        <para>When the bunk heater blower switch (593) is moved to the high, medium or low positions, power flows
            through circuit 77L, connector (905) and 75AL to sleeper temperature control (592). This allows the voltage
            from the sleeper temperature control to control the heater box flat pack.
        </para>
        <para>Power is made available by fuse F-9D to circuits 75BC and 75BJ, connector (162) and circuit 75BJ to the
            heater box damper flat pack (stepper motor). The heater box damper flat pack is grounded through circuit
            75-GL, connector (161), circuits 75-G and 11-G to right dash panel ground stud. The flat pack receives a
            variable voltage from the sleeper temperature control through connector (592), circuit 75K, connector (906),
            circuit 75K, connector (162) and circuit 75K. Thus, the damper blends hot and cold air as selected by the
            sleeper temperature control.
        </para>
        <para>When cooling is required in the sleeper and the cab A/C switch is not in the on position, the cab switch
            must be moved to the on position by the driver or sleeper occupant. Thus, the A/C compressor will engage
            (the compressor will cycle with the thermal switch) and cooling will be available for the sleeper blower.
        </para>

            <note>
                <para>This is the standard manual temperature control. The output of the system does not change with
                    changes in temperature.
