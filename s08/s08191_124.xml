                    <para>Navistar engine harness 30-way ECM connector (273) connects to ECM. This connector links the
                        Navistar switches, sensors and data links and supplies ignition power to the ECM.

            <para>Power is supplied at all times from the positive battery terminal to the ECM over two circuits. The
                first circuit consists of circuit 14A from the battery positive terminal, a 15A fuse, circuit 14D,
                connector (675), and circuit 14D to the ECM power connector (676). The second circuit consists of
                circuit 14B from the battery positive terminal, a 15A fuse, circuit 14C, connector (675), and circuit
                14C to the ECM power connector (676).
            </para>
            <para>The ECM is grounded through circuits 11-GA, 11-GB, and 11-GC to a splice. From the splice the circuits
                are grounded through circuit 11-G, connector (N/L) and circuit 11-G to the negative battery cable.
            </para>
            <para>When the key switch is in the ignition or start position, the ignition relay (462)/R1 is energized.
                With the relay energized, power is applied to circuits 13H, 13J and 13F, I1 ignition adapter (494),
                circuit 13Z, 5A fuse F9-B, circuit 13D, connector (2), and circuit 13D to the ECM (273).
