        <title>Idle Shutdown Timer</title>
        <para>This feature helps improve fuel consumption by limiting idle time. The "shutdown time" is a customer
            specified parameter, and may be from 3 to 1440 minutes. Programming the time to zero shuts the timer off.

        <para>The timer is activated and the countdown (from the customer selected time) begins when:</para>

        <para>Ninety seconds before the programmed time is reached, the Yellow Serv/Check Engine light will begin to
            flash rapidly. If the driver moves the clutch (376) or service brake (69) pedal during this 90-second time
            period, the clutch switch (376) or the brake switch (69) contacts will open up and the timer will be
            overridden until it is reset. The timer is reset and begins counting over by moving the vehicle a short
            distance.
        </para>
        <para>A code (Override of Idle Shutdown Timer) will be logged when the driver overrides the timer within the
            90-second time period. If the timer is activated and allowed to shut down the engine, then a code (Idle
            Shutdown Timed Out) will be set. These codes record an event - they do not indicate a fault in the system.
