        <title>Bunk Fluorescent and Reading Lights (With Raised Roof Cab)</title>
        <para>Power is applied by battery stud (B2) to circuits 14H and 14AP, 25A fuse F8-D, circuit 14AE, connector
            (22), and circuit 14AE to a splice.
        </para>
        <para>From the splice, power is applied to circuit 63M and the bunk reading light (564). The reading light is
            grounded through circuits 63-GM, 11-GAH, and 11-GAN, connector (81), and circuits 11-GAN and 11-GBB to the
            right cab ground (404), and illuminates when its switch is moved to the on position.
        </para>
        <para>From the splice, power also flows through circuit 63L to the fluorescent light connector (562). The ground
            circuit consists of two circuits and three switches. Thus the bunk fluorescent light will illuminate when
            the switch on the light fixture, at the bunk switch panel, or at the dash switch panel is moved to its other
            position.
        </para>
        <para>One ground path is through the light connector (562), circuit 63-GB, connector (557), circuit 63-GB,
            switch (563), circuit 63-GD, connector (557), circuit 63-GD, connector (11), circuit 63-GD, connector (19),
            circuit 63-GD, switch (589), and circuits 63-GE and 11-GLC to L3 panel ground adapter (505). The other
            ground path is through the light connector (562), circuit 63-GA, connector (557), circuit 63-GA, switch
            (563), circuit 63-GC, connector (557), circuit 63-GC, connector (11), circuit 63-GC, connector (19), circuit
            63-GC, switch (589), and circuits 63-GE and 11-GLC to L3 panel ground adapter (505).
