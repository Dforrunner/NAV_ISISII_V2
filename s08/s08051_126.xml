                                literature as an Engine Protection Light). This system monitors important engine

                                condition occurs. The engine protection also derates engine torque and engine speed when

                        <para>The low engine idle speed (rpm) can be adjusted from the cab, using a two-position
                            momentary, increment/decrement switch. This function permits adjusting idle speed up or down
                            in units of 25 rpm by toggling the switch. Maximum idle speed is 800 rpm and minimum idle
                            speed is 550 rpm. When the idle has been changed and the key turned OFF, the new setting is

                            <para>Negative data link circuit 98B(-) connects ECM connector (252) terminal 8 to Datalink
                                Negative Connector (515) at terminal B. Datalink Negative Connector (515) terminal C is
                                connected by circuit 47/48(-) to speedometer/tachometer connector (421). Datalink
                                Negative Connector (515) terminal A is connected by circuit 98C(-) to the ATA Data Link
                                connector (137) terminal B. Connector (515) has a bus installed that connects all the
                                circuits in the connector together. ATA Data Link connector (137) can be used to access
                                information on the data link using an electronic service tool.

                            <para>The lighted cruise control ON/OFF switch receives a 5V signal on circuit 97AD(5V) from
                                ECM connector (252) terminal 10. In the ON position, a 5V signal is sent from switch
                                terminal 6, on circuit 97AE to ECM connector (252) terminal 2. This indicates to the ECM
                                that the cruise control switch is in the ON position. In the OFF position, circuit 97AE
                                has 0 volts, indicating to the ECM that the switch is OFF.

                            <para>The lighted cruise Set/Resume switch is a momentary switch. This switch receives a 5V
                                signal from ECM connector (252) on circuit 97AC (5V) at terminal 2. The cruise selector
                                switch sends a 5V signal from terminal 3 on circuit 97AB to ECM connector (252) terminal
                                12 while in the SET/ACCEL position. In the RESUME/COAST position, the switch sends a 5V
                                signal from terminal 1 on circuit 97AA to ECM connector (252) terminal 22.

                        <title>Idle Shutdown Feature</title>
                        <para>Idle shutdown is a customer selectable feature. It can be enabled using Electronic Service
                            Tools. If enabled, this feature will automatically shut the engine OFF after a customer
                            selected period of time. If road speed equals 0 mph and idle shutdown is enabled, then the
                            shutdown timer will be started, even if the brake, clutch, or throttle pedal are depressed.
                            If activity occurs in the brake, clutch, or throttle pedal, the idle shutdown timer will
                            reset and restart.

                        <para>If idle shutdown is activated for the PTO mode, the engine will shut down after the
                            specified amount of time while in PTO. If the customer selected idle shutdown to be
                            deactivated in the PTO mode, then the engine will not shut down while in PTO mode.
