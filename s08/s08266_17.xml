            <title>Air Dryer (Bendix AD-9)</title>
            <para>The function of the air dryer is to collect moisture and contaminants before air reaches the first
                reservoir, thus providing moisture-free air for the air brake system. The heater in the air dryer
                prevents freeze-up in the purge drain valve during cold weather.

            <title>Drain Valve</title>
            <para>The function of the automatic drain valve is to automatically expel accumulated moisture from the air
                tank. The heater in the drain valve prevents freeze-up in the purge drain valve during cold weather
                operation.

        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Fuel Filter Wiring System</title>
            <para>The fuel filter heater is mounted in the fuel filter and when operating, it helps prevent fuel from
                gelling in the unfiltered side of the filter. The system consists of a fuel heater relay, the filter
                heating element, and a normally open thermoswitch. The switch contacts close at approximately 10&#176;C
                (50&#176;F).
            </para>
            <para>The water-in-fuel system consists of a control module, a water probe, and a warning light in the dash
                cluster. When water is present in the fuel filter, increased current will flow from the probe to ground.
                The module senses this increase and turns ON the warning light. The system also conducts a bulb check
                when the key switch is in the start position to verify the light operates.
            </para>
            <para>The fuel filter restriction light is activated when the fuel filter becomes restricted. This causes
                the fuel filter vacuum switch contacts to close and activates the light.
            </para>

            <title>Automatic Transmission Shift Solenoid System (Allison "AT")</title>
            <para>With the Allison hydraulic controlled transmission, only the shift modulator valve is controlled by
                the engine computer.
            </para>

        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Automatic Transmission Neutral Position Wiring (Allison "AT")</title>
            <para>A neutral position switch is also provided to prevent the bus from being started in drive gear.</para>

        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Hydraulic Brake System</title>
            <para>The Bendix Hydro-Max II hydraulic brake booster is offered on all hydraulic brake models. It powers a
                split system which protects against brake failure by using separate fluid lines to feed the front and
                rear axle brakes. The master cylinder provides fluid pressurized by the power steering pump and the
                Hydro-Max II booster to activate the brake pads against the disc or drums. It is a dual mode system
                which will automatically provide back-up brake power, from an electric/hydraulic pump, should there be a
                loss of power steering pump pressure.
            </para>
            <para>A warning light and alarm, which can indicate various hydraulic and electrical malfunctions, are
                standard.
            </para>
            <para>A hydraulic brake/stop light switch assembly signals the engine Electronic Control Module (ECM) and
                energizes the stop lights. The ECM uses this signal to control the PTO, cruise control, compression
                brake, vehicle retarder, cold ambient protection and idle shutdown timer systems.
