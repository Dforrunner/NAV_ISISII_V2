        <title>CAB AND TRAILER LIGHTS SWITCH AND RELAYS WIRING</title>
        <para>When the headlight switch is in the or in the parking light position, power flows through circuit 58E and
            cab and trailer lights switch unless the cab and trailer lights switch is held open. After flowing through
            the switch at (466) it flows out 58C to trailer marker lights relay (463-R8) and 58P to cab and trailer
            lights relay (464-R9). The trailer marker lights relay then becomes energized as the power flows through the
            ground circuit 58-GA and 11-G. This allows power to flow through circuit 14H, 14E, fuse F3-A, circuit 58D,
            through trailer marker lights relay, and through circuits 58R, and 58S to the trailer socket. Likewise the
            cab and trailer tail lights relay becomes energized as the power flows from the cab and trailer lights
            switch and through the ground circuit 58-G. This allows power to flow through circuit 14H, 14B, fuse F3-C,
            circuit 68, through cab and trailer tail lights relay, and through circuit 68E. From this point it flows
            through circuit 68B to the trailer socket, and 68D, fuse F8-C, and circuit 68C. From this point power flows
            out circuits to supply mirror lights, tail lights, clearance lights, panel lights, and park lights.
