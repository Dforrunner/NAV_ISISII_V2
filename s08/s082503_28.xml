        <para>Power is supplied from the vehicle batteries to the cranking motor solenoid "B" terminal on a 2/0 or 4/0
            red cable. Power from the "B" terminal is supplied through a fusible link and circuit J14H to the 100 amp
            megafuse. Power from the unfused side of the megafuse connector is fed through circuit J14H to maxifuse
            block (4000). Power from two 60A fuses in the maxifuse block is fed to the system controller on circuits
            J14A and J14B. Power from the fused side of the 100A megafuse is supplied on several circuits to power
            distribution fuse blocks (1011), (1012), (1013) and (1014). Each fuse block provides 12 volts to the fuses
            connected directly to battery power. This includes circuit A15 to the key switch.
