        <title>LOW AIR PRESSURE WARNING LIGHT AND ALARM</title>
        <para>When the vehicle air system pressure is below 60 PSI/413.7 KPa, the low air pressure warning system
            activates, turning ON the warning light and causing the alarm to sound continuously. This system includes
            the warning light located in the right gauge cluster, two low air pressure switches (one in the primary
            system and one in the secondary system) located behind the left instrument panel, and the alarm that is part
            of the Speedo/Tach cluster.
        </para>
        <para>The warning light receives 12V ignition power (key ON) from 10A fuse F4-A through cluster connector (420).
            The light ground path is through cluster connector (420) circuit 40/40A to one pressure switch and 40/40B to
            the other switch and 40/40C to the Speedo/Tach module. The switches are grounded at the left dash panel
            ground.
        </para>
        <para>With either switch closed (less than 60 PSI/413.7 KPa) the light is turned ON. With a closed pressure
            switch, circuit 40C, to Speedo/Tach control module is at a ground state, causing it to sound the alarm,
            producing short beeps continuously, until the switches are both open.
