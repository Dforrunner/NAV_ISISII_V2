        <title>IDLE/DIAGNOSTIC SWITCH</title>
        <para>The lighted two-position momentary idle/diagnostic switch is a dual function switch. The switch adjusts
            the low engine idle speed and is also used during on-board diagnostics (when the diagnostic switch is in the
            on position) to move through the diagnostic fault code list.
        </para>
        <para>The engine idle speed can be adjusted by the switch in increments of 25 rpm by toggling the switch.
            Maximum idle speed is 800 rpm and minimum idle speed is 550 rpm. When the idle has been changed and the key
            turned off, the new setting is saved in memory. This feature is owner selected and can be turned off with an
            electronic service tool.
        </para>
        <para>The switch is connected to the ECM common/ground connection by way of ECM connector (252), circuits 97-G
            and 97-GA, connector (190) and circuits 97-GA and 97-GD. Momentarily placing the switch in the increment
            position applies ground to circuit 97AV, connector (190) and circuit 97AV to the ECM (252). This causes the
            engine idle rpm to increase 25 rpm.
        </para>
        <para>Momentarily placing the switch in the decrement position applies ground to circuit 97AU, connector (190)
            and circuit 97AU to the ECM (252). This causes the engine idle rpm to decrease 25 rpm.
