        <title>Headlight System</title>
        <para>The headlight system consists of headlights, headlight switch, dimmer switch and Day Time running lights
            (mandatory for Canada, optional for USA). The fender mounted hea dlights are a two lamp system and share a
            molded cavity with the turn signals which is sealed from road spray and debris. The headlight switch is a
            3-position (off/parking lights/headlights) rocker type located on the instrument panel.
        </para>
        <para>The dimmer switch is either turn signal or floor mounted and when the turn signal stalk or the floor
            button is "clicked," the headlights will switch to either the hi-beam or low-beam position. When "clicked"
            again, the headlights will return to their original position.
        </para>
        <para>The headlight lift-to-dim on the turn signal will operate the lift-to-dim relay when the headlight switch
            is in headlight on or park light on positions.
        </para>
        <para>Trucks built between October 1, 1998 and March 16, 1999, without the new route for the headlight
            lift-to-dim relay circuit refer to CTS-5122V.
        </para>
        <para>The Day Time Running light feature allows the vehicle to operate in a "lights on" condition at all times
            without driver input. This system operates the headlights at partial illumination but still helps to
            increase visibility even in bright sunshine.
