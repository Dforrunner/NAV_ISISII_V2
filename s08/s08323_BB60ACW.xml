        </para>
        <para>60ACW - BODY INTG, I/O EXPANSION HARNESS (for Diamond Logic&#174; Builder Only) includes a harness with
            five blunt-cut wires routed on lower left of instrument panel. Two GND active inputs and two (0.5 Amp) relay
            driver outputs are provided.

            <emph type="boldundersc">FEATURE / BODY FUNCTION:</emph>
        </para>
        <para>This feature is an input/output expansion feature for Diamond Logic&#174; Builder to be utilized by Body
            Builders. This expansion feature provides the following: (2) digital inputs, (2) 0.5 AMP relay driver
            outputs, (1) ZVR on the BC as well as an expansion overlay harness that is part of the IP harness. The
            expansion overlay harness grants access to these inputs, outputs, and ZVR by providing blunt-cut wires that
            are strapped to the main IP harness trunk near the J1939 diagnostic connector on the interior of the cab.
            The overlay harness was designed to be long enough to allow the wires to be inserted into the 72-way pass
            thru connector if desired.
        </para>
        <para>When this feature is added to the vehicle, the body controller pins will not show up on the connector view
            of DLB until they are written to with Advanced Logic. 595AKH must be turned on and the inputs/outputs must
            be used in Advanced Logic to show up on the connector view of DLB. The following pins are NOT assigned with
            595AKH Digital Logic must be used to assign these pins.
