        <title>WITH KYSOR ENGINE SHUTDOWN</title>
        <para>When starting a Kysor equipped vehicle, for the first 30 seconds the ignition power to the PCU and fuel
            shutoff solenoid is controlled by the Kysor Control Module. During the 30-second start period, the Kysor
            Control Module supplies ignition voltage (circuit P19A) to the PCU and the fuel shutoff solenoid from the
            Kysor relay (93).
        </para>
        <para>After the 30-second start interval, the ignition power source to the PCU and fuel shutoff solenoid is
            controlled by the Alarmstat and the Pressurestat. Circuit 19J/19D from the alarmstat supplies the voltage to
            the fuel shutoff solenoid and PCU after the 30-second delay period has ended and sufficient oil pressure is
            available to close the NO contact in the pressurestat.
        </para>
        <para>In the event of low oil pressure (less than 5 PSI) or high engine coolant temperatures (higher than 225
            degrees F), the power to the fuel shutoff solenoid and the PCU is cut off, which will shut down the engine
            to prevent engine damage.
