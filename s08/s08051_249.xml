        <para>When the bunk dome light switch is moved at either of the two locations or the sleeper dome light switch
            is moved, current will flow from battery stud B2, through circuit 14AP, fuse F8 - D, circuit 63AA, and 63AP
            to the bunk fluorescent light. The ground circuit is 63 - GJ or 63 - GK between the two bunk dome light
            switches, and circuit 63 - GE or 63 - GF going to the sleeper dome light switch, and circuit 63 - GA, 11 -
            GAB, and 11 - GB to ground stud at right dash panel.
        </para>
        <para>When the bunk reading light switch is turned ON, current will flow from battery stud B2, through circuit
            14AK, 14AP, fuse F8 - D, circuit 63AA, and 63U to the reading light switch and lamp. The ground circuit is
            63 - GU, 11 - GAD, 11 - GBD, and 11 - GBE to ground adapter (454).
        </para>
        <para>When the under cabinet light switch is turned ON, current will flow from battery stud B2 through circuit
            14AK, 14AP, fuse F8 - D, circuit 63AA, and 63AR to the under cabinet light switch and lamp. The ground
            circuit is 63 - GR, 11 - GAD, 11 - GBD, and 11 - GBE to ground adapter(454).
