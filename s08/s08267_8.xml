            <para>Power is applied by body builder feed stud (J1) to circuit 14A, fuse F3, and circuit 85 to the coil of
                horn relay (61). When the horn button is depressed, power flows through the horn relay coil and through
                circuit 85A, connector (222), circuit 85A, connector (N/L), circuit 85A, slip ring (J3), circuit 85A,
                the horn button switch, and circuit 85-GB to the steering column ground.

                connector (605), and circuit 85B to a splice. From the splice, power flows through circuit 85D to the
                low note horn, and 85C to the high note horn. A ground path is provided by the starter ground through
                circuit 11-GJ/11-GB, connector (425M), circuit 11-GB/85-G, connector (605), and circuit 85-G to a
