        <title>KYSOR ENGINE SHUTDOWN</title>
        <svcprocinfo>
            <para>On vehicles equipped with the Kysor system, battery voltage to power the ECM is controlled by the Run
                Relay, which is in turn controlled by the Kysor system alarmstat (engine coolant temperature switch) and
                surestat (engine oil pressure switch) and the Kysor Control Module (30-second automatic override).
            </para>
            <para>The three primary components of the Kysor system are:</para>

            <title>Kysor Control Module</title>
            <para>The Kysor Control Module is a time delay switch that remains closed for approximately 30 seconds after
                the engine is started and the start switch is released. Ignition current from J1 flows through the
                control module contacts (1 to 3) and on circuit 97A to activate the Run Relay. Activating the Run Relay
                allows battery current to flow through the relay contacts (30 to 87) and through G4 fuse (15 amp) to the
                ECM (terminal 1). Normally after 30 seconds of engine operation, the oil pressurestat has closed and
                control of the Run Relay is through the pressurestat and the alarmstat on circuit 19H.
            </para>
            <para>After 30 seconds of engine operation, the Control Module switch will open. If the pressurestat NO
                (normally open) switch (closed with 3 psi oil pressure) or the NC (normally closed) switch of the
                alarmstat is not closed, the Run Relay will be deactivated, shutting down the engine.
            </para>
        </svcsubproc>
        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Pressurestat</title>
            <para>The Pressurestat is in the circuit to monitor engine oil pressure. It consists of two sets of contacts
                which are sensitive to engine oil pressure. One set of contacts, NO (normally open), controls the
                voltage to the Run Relay control circuit through the C (common) terminal on the alarmstat. The other set
                of contacts, NC (normally closed), controls the ignition voltage to the Kysor alarm and engine shutdown
                light.
            </para>
            <para>The NC (normally closed) contacts of the pressurestat control the alarm system. When the ignition
                switch is in the ON position, the normally closed pressurestat contacts stay closed until the oil
                pressure exceeds approximately 6 psi, then they open and the alarm is turned off. If the oil pressure
                drops below approximately 6 psi, the NC (normally closed) contacts will close, sounding the alarm and
                illuminating the warning light. The alarm will continue to sound until the key switch is turned off.
            </para>
            <para>The NO (normally open) contacts of the pressurestat control the ignition voltage needed to keep the
                Run Relay activated. With the ignition switch in the ON position, the normally open contacts will close
                when the engine oil pressure exceeds approximately 3 psi. Ignition voltage will then pass through the
                pressurestat to the alarmstat to keep the Run Relay activated. If the engine oil pressure drops below 3
                psi, the NO (normally open) contacts will open and deactivate the Run Relay, shutting down the engine.
            </para>
        </svcsubproc>
        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Alarmstat</title>
            <para>The Alarmstat also has two sets of contacts. These contacts are sensitive to engine coolant
                temperature. The NC (normally closed) contacts provide an ignition voltage path from the pressurestat to
                keep the Run Relay activated. The NO (normally open) contacts control the alarm system in the event
                operating temperatures are exceeded.
            </para>
            <para>The NC (normally closed) alarmstat contacts that control the Run Relay will remain closed unless the
                engine coolant temperature exceeds 230 degrees F. If the NC (normally closed) contacts open, the Run
                Relay will be deactivated, shutting down the engine.
            </para>
            <para>The NO (normally open) alarmstat contacts that control the alarm system will close if engine coolant
                temperatures exceed 224 degrees F. (six degrees before engine shutdown will occur). If the NO (normally
                open) contacts close, voltage is applied to the alarm and to the engine shutdown light.
            </para>
        </svcsubproc>
        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Kysor Engine Shutdown Light</title>
            <para>The Kysor shutdown light receives ignition power from J1 when the Pressurestat NC (normally closed)
                contacts are closed and the alarmstat normally open contacts are closed. The warning light is grounded
                at J2 (right instrument panel).
            </para>
            <para>In summary, the pressurestat NC (normally closed) contacts will close and activate the alarm system if
                oil pressure drops to approximately 6 psi. If oil pressure drops to 3 psi, the NO (normally open)
                contacts will open and deactivate the Run Relay, shutting down the engine. The alarmstat NO (normally
                open) contacts will close at 224 degrees F. and activate the alarm system. At 230 degrees F., the NC
                (normally closed) contacts will open and deactivate the Run Relay, shutting down the engine.
