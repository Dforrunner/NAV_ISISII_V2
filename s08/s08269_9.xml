            <title>Battery Power</title>
            <para>The vehicle batteries are connected in parallel and provide power, via the positive battery cable, to
                the cranking motor solenoid "B" stud.
            </para>
            <para>The negative battery terminals are also connected in parallel and provide a ground path, via the
                negative battery cable, to the cranking motor ground stud. The frame, engine block, and the cab platform
                are also interconnected by ground cables to the battery ground.
            </para>
            <para>For additional information on the operating principles for batteries, refer to GROUP 08 - ELECTRICAL,
                in the CTS-5000 Master Service Manual.

            <title>Cranking System and Circuits</title>
            <para>With the transmission in neutral (neutral position switch contacts closed) power flows from the key
                switch (20) through circuit 13/13A/13K, fuse F10, circuit 97P, engine cab connector (15) and circuit 97P
                to the neutral position switch. Power flows through the switch contacts, circuit 97AU, circuit 97L to
                the crank inhibit relay (R2) switch. With a manual transmission, a jumper bypasses the neutral position
                switch. A splice also provides the current from 97AU to ECM pin C26 through circuit 97A, engine cab
                connector (15) and circuit 97A. This informs the ECM that the transmission is in neutral or the clutch
                pedal is depressed.
            </para>
            <para>With the vehicle in neutral and the key switch (20) in the start position, current flows from the (J2)
                battery feed stud through circuit 14, a splice, circuit 19, fuse F16, circuit 15, and to the key switch
                (20). From the key switch, current flows through circuit 17 to the crank inhibit relay (R2) coil. If
                cranking is enabled the relay coil is grounded through circuit 97H and the engine cab connector (15) to
                ECM pin C46.
            </para>
            <para>The energized crank inhibit relay (R2) controls the start relay (387) by supply power to the relay
                coil through circuit 17A, cab connector (2) and circuit 17F. The coil is ground through circuit 17D to
                the crank motor ground stud.
            </para>
            <para>For additional information on the operating principles for cranking motors, refer to GROUP 08 -
                ELECTRICAL in the CTS-5000 Master Service Manual.

        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Cranking System and Circuits - Starter Relay Switch</title>
            <para>Battery power is always present at the crank motor solenoid (B) terminal through the 4/0 positive
                battery cable. The 3/0 negative battery cable is attached to the crank motor ground stud which is
                grounded to the frame rail. Power is also available at the start relay (387) through the solenoid (B)
                terminal and circuit 17-FL/17B. With the starter relay energized, power flows through the closed
                contacts and circuit 17C to the (S) terminal of the crank motor solenoid which energizes the solenoid.
            </para>
            <para>With the crank motor solenoid energized, the solenoid engages the crank motor's shaft to rotate. When
                the engine starts and the key is released, power is removed from circuit 17 which de-energizes the start
                relay (387) and disengages the crank motor.
            </para>
        </svcsubproc>
        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Cranking System and Circuits - Cranking Motor Thermal Overcrank Protection</title>
            <para>On vehicles with optional crank motor thermal overcrank protection, the starter relay control coil
                ground 17D is connected to the normally closed thermal overcrank protection switch (N/L) located in the
                end of the cranking motor. The overcrank protection switch is grounded through circuits 17D, 17-G, and
                11-GJ to the crank motor ground stud.
            </para>
            <para>If excessive cranking causes the crank motor temperature to exceed a pre-set temperature limit, the
                thermal overcrank protection switch contacts open and causes the starter relay to de-energize and the
                crank motor to disengage. When the crank motor cools, the thermal switch contacts reset and the crank
                motor can be engaged.

        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Charging System</title>
            <para>With the engine running, the function of the alternator is to produce direct current (DC) in order to
                supply power to the vehicle electrical system, and to charge the batteries.
            </para>
            <para>The alternator supplies the vehicle electrical system through the alternator (+) terminal, circuits 2
                and 14, to the (J2) battery feed stud.
            </para>
            <para>Any current above the needs of the vehicle electrical system is used to supply the batteries. The
                alternator charges the batteries through the (+) terminal, circuits 2, 14A, 14-FL and 14A-FL to the "B"
                terminal of the crank motor solenoid and through the battery cable to the battery positive terminal.
            </para>
            <para>The ground path for the alternator is the (-) terminal, and circuit 2-G to the crank motor ground
                stud.
            </para>
            <para>For additional information on the operating principles for alternators, refer to GROUP 08 - ELECTRICAL
                in the CTS-5000 Master Service Manual.

        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Charging System - Ammeter</title>
            <para>The optional ammeter gauge indicates the rate of charge of electric current supplied by the alternator
                to the batteries, or the rate of discharge from the batteries.
            </para>
            <para>When the alternator produces more current than the vehicle electrical circuits demand, the additional
                output charges the batteries, and the ammeter indicates the charge through circuits 26-FL, engine cab
                connector (15) and 26 to the ammeter.
            </para>
            <para>When the electrical circuits demand more current than the alternator produces, current flows from the
                batteries to the vehicle electrical system, and the ammeter shows a discharge through circuits 26A-FL,
                engine cab connector (15) and 26A to the ammeter.
