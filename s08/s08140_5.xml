            <title>Standard Engine Protection System</title>
            <para>CELECT engines are equipped with an engine protection system as a standard feature. This system
                monitors important engine parameters and logs diagnostic faults when an over- or under-normal operating
                range condition occurs. The engine protection also derates engine torque and engine speed when certain
                engine fluid parameters pass a limit point.
            </para>
            <para>All CELECT engines monitor the following five inputs:</para>

            <para>If any of the above sensors signals conditions outside limits pre-set by CUMMINS, the oil/water
                warning light will begin to flash and the engine will be gradually derated. If the out-of-specification
                condition returns to acceptable limits, the light will turn off, and the fault may be logged as an
                inactive fault in the ECM.

            <para>This feature is optional and must be selected by the customer. The engine protection shutdown is
                triggered when the engine protection lamp starts flashing for the current engine protection/warning
                derate. Once triggered, the engine will shut down after 30 seconds. During the 30 second warning period,
                the standard torque and speed derates will occur. The engine can be restarted by cycling the key switch.
                After the engine is restarted, it will be limited to the maximum torque and/or speed derate levels of
                the out-of-range parameter if the engine protection fault is still active.

            <para>All CELECT systems have three warning lights located in the instrument panel. Each Celect system
                includes a standard engine protection system to prevent engine damage.

            <para>The low engine idle speed (rpm) can be adjusted with a two-position momentary, increment/decrement

                toggling the switch. Maximum idle speed is 800 rpm and minimum idle speed is 550 rpm. When the idle has
                been changed and the key turned OFF, the new setting is saved in memory. This feature is owner selected
                and can be turned OFF with a Compulink&#8482; adjustment.

                (increment) or terminal 23 (decrement). This causes the engine idle rpm to be increased or decreased in
