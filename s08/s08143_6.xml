            <para>The ECM shares control of the Engine Brake System with the vehicle driver and the Antilock Brake
                System (ABS) if the vehicle is so equipped. The operator turns ON the engine brake ON/OFF switch and
                selects two-, four- or six-cylinder braking (the selection is different with the N14 than the L10) with
                the cylinder selector switch.
            </para>
            <para>If the vehicle is equipped with ABS, the 12-volt power supply to the Engine Brake ON/OFF is from the
                ABS Engine Brake relay. This allows the ABS system to turn OFF the engine brake when wheel slip is
                detected.

            <title>Engine Brake On/Off Switch (220)</title>
            <para>The engine brake on/off switch is a 2-pole, single throw switch. One pole (with switch closed) sends
                12V ignition power from S18 circuit breaker to the engine brake enable relay (309) at the normally open
                terminal.
            </para>
            <para>With ABS, the power supply from S18 is switched ON or OFF by the ABS Engine Brake Relay (361).
                <emph type="bold">The ABS system is discussed in GROUP 04 - BRAKES in the CTS-5000 Master Service
                    Manual.
                </emph>
            </para>
            <para>The other pole (with switch closed) sends a 5 volt signal to the ECM at terminal #5. This signal tells
                the ECM that the engine brake switch is in the ON position.
            </para>
        </svcsubproc>
        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Engine Brake Enable Relay (309)</title>
            <para>The engine brake enable relay must be energized by voltage from the ECM for the engine brake to
                operate. A 12V signal from the ECM 9-way connector (308) on circuit 24AA activates the engine brake
                enable relay control coil which is grounded at the right cowl inner panel. The ECM enables the engine
                brake system using the relay, if all previously discussed conditions are judged to be correct.

        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Engine Brake Selector Switch (221)</title>
            <para>The engine brake selector switch sends the 12 volt ignition power through the ECM 9-way connector to
                selected engine brake solenoids. The power does not go through the ECM.

            <para>system. When the brakes
                <emph type="underscr">are not applied</emph>, a 5V signal is applied to ECM terminal #13. The normally
                closed service brake switch opens when the brakes are applied and the 5V is not applied to ECM terminal
                #13.

            <title>Clutch Switch</title>
            <para>The clutch switch serves both the cruise and engine brake system. The switch is a normally open
                switch, adjusted to be closed when the clutch pedal is in the released position. With the clutch
                released, a 5V signal is applied through the clutch switch to ECM terminal #4.
