        <title>Accelerator Position Sensor (APS) and Idle Validation Switch (IVS)</title>
        <para>The engine Electronic Control Module (ECM) determines the position of the accelerator pedal by processing
            the input signals from the Accelerator Position Sensor (APS) and Idle Validation Switch (IVS).
        </para>
        <para>The ECM sends a regulated 5 volt signal through the black ECM connector (379), circuit 97U, bulkhead
            connector (3), circuit 97U to a splice, and circuit 99C to the APS/IVS (382). The APS then returns a
            variable voltage signal (depending on pedal position) from connector (382), circuit 99B, connector (3), and
            circuit 99B to ECM connector (379). The APS is grounded through circuit 99A/97W, connector (3), and circuit
            97WB/97W to ECM (379).
        </para>
        <para>The ECM learns the lowest and highest pedal positions by reading and storing the minimum and the maximum
            voltage levels from the APS. In this manner the ECM "auto-calibrates" the system to allow maximum pedal
            sensitivity. The ECM auto-calibrates as the key is on, but when the key is turned off, these values are
            lost. When the key is turned on again, this process starts over. When the pedal is disconnected (or a new
            one is installed), the pedal does not need to be calibrated, as the calibration happens when the key is
            turned on.
        </para>
        <para>The Idle Validation Switch (IVS) (382) receives 12 volt ignition voltage from key switch (24), circuits
            13A, 13B, fuse F17 and circuit 99E. When the pedal is not in the idle position (throttle applied), the IVS
            sends this 12 volt signal to the ECM over circuit 99D, connector (3), and circuit 99D to the ECM (379).
        </para>
        <para>The ECM (379) compares the inputs it receives on circuit 99B and circuit 99D from the APS/IVS to verify
            when the pedal is in the idle position. If the APS signal from circuit 99B indicates throttle is being
            applied, then the ECM expects to see 12 volts at IVS circuit 99D. If the APS signal, circuit 99B, indicates
            throttle is not applied, then the ECM expects to see 0 volts at the IVS circuit 99D. The timing process is
            critical between the APS and the IVS sensors. For this reason, it is very difficult to determine if the
            APS/IVS assembly is working properly using a volt-ohmmeter.
