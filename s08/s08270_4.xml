        <title>ACCESSORY</title>
        <para>Power from battery stud (B1) is applied to circuits 14BH and 14C, 25A fuse F7-A, and circuit 15 to the key
            switch (452). When the key switch is placed in the accessories position, power is applied to circuit 12M,
            and 10A radio and CB fuse F5-B, and power is also applied to circuits 12 and 12D to the A2 accessories
            adapter (581).
        </para>
        <para>With the key switch in accessories position, power is also applied to circuits 12 and 12AC, and the coil
            of the accessories feed relay (446-R15). The relay is grounded through circuits 12-GH, 82-GD, and 11-GD to
            the left cab ground (429). This energizes the relay and allows power to flow from the battery stud (B1)
            through circuits 14K and 14AJ, 25A fuse F4-B, circuit 14BB, the N.O. contacts of relay (446-R15), and
            circuit 12AF to a splice. From the splice power flows through circuit 12L to the defroster fans and power
            mirror 15A fuse F5-A. From the splice power also flows through circuit 12AD to the A3 accessories adapter
            (593).
        </para>
        <para>With the key switch in accessories position, power is also applied to circuits 12 and 12AH, the A1
            accessories adapter (516), and power is applied to circuit 12F and the wiper intermittent relay (444).
