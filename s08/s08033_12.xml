            <para>Test procedures outlined in this section can be followed to locate the cause of trouble in the
                speedometer/tachometer system. The sequence of steps in trouble shooting the system is included the test
                descriptions and illustrated in
                <emph type="bold">Diagnostic Charts</emph>
                and

                    <para>For initial installation of the speedometer/tachometer unit in the vehicle at the assembly
                        plant all the DIP switches are set to zero. This allows manufacturing personnel to
                        electronically program the speedometer/tachometer unit using the data link connector on the
                        unit. The DIP switches remain at zero and the switch positions that are programmed into the unit
                        are on a sticker placed on the speedometer/tachometer unit along with the Job Number for the
                        vehicle when ordered. The same DIP switch setting and Job Number should appear on the vehicle
                        lineset ticket. The switches can be moved from the zero position and if all switches are
                        returned to the zero position the original setting will be intact.

                    <para>To perform TEST 1 or 2 with Caterpillar 3406B engine with PEEC and Kysor engine shutdown, the
                        power to the speedometer/tachometer unit comes through the Run Relay when the run relay is
                        activated by starting the engine. To perform TEST 1 or 2, which require "key switch ON" in this
                        section without running the engine, install a jumper wire connecting the number 1 and number 3
                        terminals of the Kysor control module. BE SURE TO REMOVE THE JUMPER BEFORE STARTING THE ENGINE.
