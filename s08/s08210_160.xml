        <title>Determining Fault Codes</title>
        <svcprocinfo>
            <para>The ECM continuously monitors itself and other system components, including sensors, injectors,
                connectors and associated wiring.
            </para>
            <para>
                <emph type="bold">The yellow Engine Warning Light is turned on</emph>
                if a minor fault occurs. A fault code is also logged. This indicates the problem should be diagnosed as
                soon as possible.
            </para>
            <para>
                <emph type="bold">The ECM turns on the yellow Engine Warning Light and the red Stop Engine Light</emph>
                and stores a fault code if a major fault is detected. If this occurs, the vehicle should be brought to a
                safe stop and the engine shut down.
            </para>
            <para>A diagnostic check may be performed using the diagnostic on/off switch, the EZ-Tech or Pro-Link 9000
                EST.

            <title>Diagnostic OnOff/Shutdown Override Switch</title>
            <para>The diagnostic on/off switch is used to signal the ECM to flash the yellow Engine Warning light and
                the red Stop Engine light to flash codes. The red Stop Engine light will flash the ACTIVE codes and the
                yellow Engine Warning light will flash the INACTIVE codes.
            </para>
            <para>If no fault codes are logged, the code "25" will be flashed out on the yellow Engine Warning Light.
                For example, the yellow Engine Warning light blinks out: FLASH, FLASH. The first digit is a 2, then a
                half-second pause: FLASH, FLASH, FLASH, FLASH, FLASH. The second digit is a 5. Code 25 is System OK.
            </para>
            <para>The diagnostic on/off switch is used to flash codes in the following circumstances:</para>

                        diagnostic on/off switch will flash out the engine codes. Toggling then releasing the diagnostic
                        on/off switch a second time will stop the ECM from flashing the codes.

                        the diagnostic on/off switch will flash out the engine codes. Toggling then releasing the
                        diagnostic on/off switch a second time will stop the ECM from flashing the codes.

            <para>If the fault code(s) or symptoms indicate a need to troubleshoot an International installed circuit or
                component, procedures are included in this chapter or other CTS-5000 Master Service Manual sections.

            <para>The EZ-Tech or the PRO-LINK 9000 electronic service tools (EST) with a Series 60 program can be used
                to read logged fault codes and monitor many of the system switches and operating parameters. Refer to
                the EZ-Tech and PRO-LINK 9000 manuals for information on using the EST.
            </para>
            <para>International vehicles include an 6-way diagnostic connector used to access the system with an EST.

            <para>The diagnostic tables in this section are not designed for specific symptoms, but designed to test
                those circuits and components installed by International. Use DDEC III diagnostics procedures to
                identify the suspect circuit or system, then use the procedures included in this section to troubleshoot
                the specific International circuit.
