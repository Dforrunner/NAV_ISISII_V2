        <title>LOW AIR PRESSURE WARNING LIGHT AND ALARM</title>
        <para>When the vehicle air system pressure is below 60 psi, the low air pressure warning system activates,
            turning ON the warning light and causing the alarm to sound continuously. This system includes the warning
            light located in the right gauge cluster, two low air pressure switches (one in the primary system and one
            in the secondary system) located behind the left instrument panel, and the alarm that is part of the
            Speedometer/Tachometer cluster.
        </para>
        <para>The warning light receives 12V ignition power (key ON) from 10A fuse F4-A through cluster connector (420).
            The light ground path is through cluster connector (420) circuit 40/40A to one pressure switch and 40/40B to
            the other switch and 40/40C to the Speedometer/Tachometer module. The switches are grounded at the left dash
            panel ground.
        </para>
        <para>With either switch closed (less than 60 psi) the light is turned ON. With a closed pressure switch,
            circuit 40C, to Speedometer/Tachometer control module is at a ground state, causing it to sound the alarm,
            producing short beeps continuously, until the switches are both open.
