            <para>The idle shutdown timer can be pro- grammed to shut down the engine after the engine is allowed to
                remain at idle for a specified time period (3 -60 minutes). To activate the Idle Shutdown Timer, the
                following conditions must be met:

            <para>After the park brake is engaged, the idle shutdown feature begins to count down the selected time
                period. The engine can be idling at low idle or at an idle rpm selected by the PTO governor. Ninety
                seconds before the programmed shutdown time is reached, the ENGINE WARNING LIGHT begins to flash
                rapidly.
            </para>
            <para>To overide the idle timer shutdown feature, the service brake or clutch pedal must be moved during the
                90 seconds when the ENGINE WARNING LIGHT is flashing. This allows the engine to be idled for extensive
                periods. Failure to move the service brake or clutch pedal while the ENGINE WARNING LIGHT is flashing
                allows the engine to shut down at the programmed time.

                    <para>The ECM monitors system activity and records two events: (1) when the idle shutdown timer is
                        activated and shuts down the engine, and (2) when the idle shutdown timer is activated, but is
                        overridden before actual shutdown. These events are electronically recorded for informational
                        purposes. The fault codes do not require service.

            <title>Park Brake Switch (326)</title>
            <para>The purpose of the park brake switch is to enable (turn on) the shutdown timer. The Park Brake switch
                is closed with the park brake applied and open when the park brake is released.
            </para>
            <para>Park Brake Switch circuit (97E) is an input to the ECM through ECM connector (320) terminal #11. The
                ground side of the Park Brake switch is connected through circuit 97-GR/97-GA to ECM connector (320)
                terminal #2. With the park brake released (switch open), the ECM sees 5 volts at ECM connector (320)
                terminal #11. Applying the brakes closes the switch, and the ECM sees 0 volts at terminal #11.
