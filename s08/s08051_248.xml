        <para>When the sleeper dome light switch is ON, and the bunk dome light switch is moved at either of the two
            locations, current will flow from battery stud B2, through circuit 14AP, fuse F8 - D, circuit 14AX, 14P,
            fuse K2, and circuit 63F to the bunk fluorescent light. The ground circuit is 11U or 11P between the two
            bunk dome light switches, and circuit 11C, sleeper dome light switch, and 11G to sleeper ground.
