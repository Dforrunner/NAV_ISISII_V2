            <para>The cranking motor provides the rotation of the engine crankshaft, through the flywheel, that is
                needed to start the engine.
            </para>
            <para>The cranking motor circuits provide power to the cranking motor to turn over the crankshaft of the
                engine. If all other systems are operational, the engine will start.
            </para>
            <para>Components of the system with International engines consist of the crank motor and solenoid, the key
                start switch (or push button), starter ISO &#38; power relay, the engine electronic control module
                (ECM), and a clutch switch with a manual transmission or a neutral position signal with an automatic
                transmission.
            </para>
            <specpara>
                <note>
                    <para>Vehicles with the Auto Neutral feature will also use a crank inhibit relay.</para>

            </specpara>
            <para>When the clutch pedal is pushed, or the automatic transmission is in park or neutral the engine
                controller will provide a ground to the starter ISO &#38; power relay . When the key is in the start
                position, 12 volts will be applied to the relay causing it to energize. The energized relay will supply
                12 volts to the cranking motor solenoid causing it to energize and apply battery voltage to the cranking
                motor.
            </para>
            <specpara>
                <note>
                    <para>Cranking motors ending in a type 50, like 350 or 450, contain thermal overcrank protection.
                    </para>
                </note>
            </specpara>
            <para>On vehicles using starters with thermal overcrank protection, excessive cranking will cause cranking
                motor temperature to reach a pre-set thermal overcrank limit. The thermal switch will then open causing
                the motor to disengage. When the thermal switch opens it interrupts a ground signal from the engine
                controller to the coil of the starter relay, preventing it from energizing. When the crank motor cools,
                the switch closes, permitting the crank motor to operate again.
