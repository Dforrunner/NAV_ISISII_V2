        <svcprocinfo>
            <para>The diagnostic display mode may be entered for viewing of codes at any speed. Active codes can only be
                cleared when the output speed = 0 and no output speed sensor failure is active. The codes can be cleared
                by two methods: by using an electronic diagnostic tool with the appropriate software or by using the
                Shift Selector Display. The use of the electronic service tool is described in the instruction manual
                furnished with each tool and software, and will not be discussed in this manual. The method of reading
                and cleaning codes described in this section refers to only entering the Diagnostic Display Mode by
                proper button and/or shift lever movement.

                    <para>The diagnostic display mode on the shift selector may only be entered when the vehicle is
                        stopped. The vehicle is stopped when sensor output speed = zero and no output speed sensor
                        failure is active; OR if any output speed sensor failure is active (code 22 16) when turbine
                        speed = zero. Codes may only be cleared under the same circumstances.

                    Read the first code in the first of five code positions on the digital display on the shift
                    selector. The digital display shows the first code in three steps. For example, code 25 11 located
                    in the first position would be read as follows:
