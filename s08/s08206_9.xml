        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Turn Signal Indicators - Left Turn Signal</title>
            <para>When the left turn signal is selected, power is applied from fuse F3 through flasher 4A to pin A of
                connector (193). The circuit continues on circuits 56 and 56C through pin 6 of connector (27). This
                causes the left turn indicator, which is grounded through pin 2 of connector (27) and circuit 28-GB, to
                illuminate when the flasher makes the turn signal blink.
            </para>
        </svcsubproc>
        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Turn Signal Indicators - Right Turn Signal</title>
            <para>When the right turn signal is selected, power is applied from fuse F3 through flasher 4A to pin D of
                connector (193). The circuit continues on circuits 57 and 57C through pin 12 of connector (27). This
                causes the right turn indicator, which is grounded through pin 2 of connector (27) and circuit 28-GB, to
                illuminate as the flasher makes the turn signal blink.
            </para>

        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Water-In-Fuel</title>
            <para>When the fuel filter has water in it, the water probe provides a ground at pin A of connector (2) on
                circuit 19C to pin D of the water-in-fuel module. The water-in-fuel module supplies 12 volts on circuit
                19L through pin 11 of connector (28) to illuminate the "WATER-IN-FUEL" indicator.
            </para>
        </svcsubproc>
        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Wait-to-Start</title>
            <para>The "WAIT-TO-START" indicator is controlled by the ECM. A ground is sent from the ECM through pin 53
                of connector (379), through pin 28 of connector (3), to pin 5 of connector (28). This causes the
                indicator to illuminate.
            </para>
        </svcsubproc>
        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Headlight Hi-Beam</title>
            <para>When the headlight switch (60) is in the on position, power is supplied to the dimmer relay (4J) on
                pins 1 and 3. When the high beam switch (15) is activated, the ground on circuit 51-G through pin A of
                connector (192) to the switch is removed as the switch is opened. This removes the ground on circuit 51D
                to contact 2 of dimmer relay (4J), causing the relay to de-energize. This applies 12 volts to contact 4
                of the relay on circuits 52C and 52A, through pin 4 of connector (27), to illuminate the high beam
                indicator on the instrument panel.
            </para>
        </svcsubproc>
        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Change Oil</title>
            <para>The "CHANGE OIL" indicator is initiated by the ECM. A ground is sent on pin 45 of connector (379), on
                circuit 97AA through pin 18 of connector (3), to pin 7 of connector (28). The ground causes the
                indicator to illuminate.
            </para>
            <specpara>
                <note>
                    <para>The Change Oil/Service interval light default setting is off. The customer can use the service
                        tool to activate the light and enter their own parameters into the ECM memory. The STI button
                        (diagnostics flash button) is used to reset the service interval reminder light.
                    </para>

        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Fuel Filter</title>
            <para>When the fuel filter becomes clogged or restricted, the fuel filter vacuum switch (2FF) will close
                applying a ground on circuit 19B through pin B of connector (401), on circuit 19E to pin R of connector
                (2), on circuit 19B to pin 3 of connector (28), which illuminates the "FUEL FILTER" indicator.
            </para>
        </svcsubproc>
        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Suspension Low Air</title>
            <para>A ground from circuit 61-G through pin A of connector (475) is present at the air pressure sensor.
                When the suspension air pressure is low, the air pressure sensor will close applying ground through pin
                C of connector (475) on circuits 40 and 40A to pin 13 of connector (28). This causes the suspension low
                air indicator to illuminate and the alarm, which receives power and the ground through connector (474),
                to sound.
            </para>
        </svcsubproc>
        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Warning Engine</title>
            <para>The "WARN ENGINE" indicator is controlled by the ECM. Inputs from the engine sensors to the ECM are
                processed to determine this condition. A ground is sent from the ECM through pin 55 of connector (379),
                through pin 25 of connector (3), to pin 15 of connector (28), which causes the indicator to illuminate
                and the audible alarm to sound.
            </para>
        </svcsubproc>
        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Oil/Water</title>
            <para>The "OIL/WATER" indicator is controlled by the ECM. The ECM receives inputs from the engine sensors
                and the coolant surge tank. These inputs are processed to determine this condition. A ground is sent
                from the ECM through pin 54 of connector (379), through pin 16 of connector (3), to pin 14 of connector
                (28), which illuminates the indicator.
            </para>
        </svcsubproc>
        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Brake Pressure</title>
            <para>When the hydraulic brake module (49) detects a problem with the brake system, it provides a ground on
                circuit 90T to pin 9 of connector (28). The brake pressure warning light, which is powered by fuse F13,
                will illuminate and an audible alarm will sound.
            </para>
        </svcsubproc>
        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Park Brake</title>
            <para>When the parking brake is engaged the park brake switch (1PB) will close providing a ground on circuit
                44A and 44 to pin 17 of connector (28) causing the "Park Brake" indicator to illuminate.
            </para>
        </svcsubproc>
        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Low Voltage</title>
            <para>When the voltage output of the alternator is low, a ground will be provided on terminal (1) of the
                alternator. This ground will be present on circuit 1C to pin 16 of connector (28) and will cause the low
                voltage indicator to illuminate.
