            <para>With the key switch (452) on or in the accessories position, power is applied to accessories adapter
                A1 (516), circuit 12Y, and left side electric window relay (448). Thus current flows through the relay
                coil and circuits 12-GY and 11-GAT to the G2 ground adapter (455). This energizes the relay and applies
                power from the B1 battery adapter (517) to circuit 14AV, 25A fuse F10-A (location may vary), circuit
                83F, and the relay. Power is then applied to the N.O. contacts, circuit 83J, and the left side power
                window switch (420).
            </para>
            <para>With the window switch in the down position, power flows through the switch, circuit 83DA, connector
                (437), circuit 83D, connector (57), and a red wire to the window motor. A ground path is applied to the
                motor by way of a blue wire, connector (57), circuit 83C, connector (437), circuit 83CA, switch (420),
                circuits 83-GA and 11-GAT to the G2 ground adapter (455), thus causing the motor to run, and the window
                to move in the down direction.
            </para>
            <para>With the window switch in the up position, power flows through the switch, circuit 83CA, connector
                (437), circuit 83C, connector (57), and a blue wire to the window motor. A ground path is applied to the
                motor by way of a red wire, connector (57), circuit 83D, connector (437), circuit 83DA, switch (420),
                circuits 83-GA and 11-GAT to the G2 ground adapter (455), thus causing the motor to run, and the window
                to move in the up direction.

            <para>With the key switch (452) on or in the accessories position, power is applied to accessories adapter
                A1 (516), circuit 12W, and right side electric window relay (449). Thus, current flows through the relay
                coil and circuits 12-GW and 11-GAU to the G3 ground adapter (456). This energizes the relay and applies
                power from the B1 battery adapter (517) to circuit 14BD, 25A fuse F10-A (location may vary), circuit 83,
                and the relay. Power is then applied to the N.O. contacts, circuit 83H, and the right side power window
                passenger switch (506).
            </para>
            <para>With the passenger switch in the down position, power flows through the switch, circuit 83D, connector
                (403), circuit 83D, connector (16), a white wire, connector (34), and a red wire to the window motor. A
                ground path is applied to the motor by way of a black wire, connector (34), a black wire, connector
                (16), circuit 83C, connector (403), circuit 83C, switch (506), circuit 83A, switch (413), circuits 83-G
                and 11-GAU to the G3 ground adapter (456), thus causing the motor to run, and the window to move in the
                down direction.

                the window motor. A ground path is applied to the motor by way of a red wire, connector (34), a white
                wire, connector (16), circuit 83D, connector (403), circuit 83D, switch (506), circuit 83B, switch
                (413), circuits 83-G and 11-GAU to the G3 ground adapter (456), thus causing the motor to run, and the
                window to move in the up direction.
