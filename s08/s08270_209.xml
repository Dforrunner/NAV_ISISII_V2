        <title>Fog Lights</title>
        <para>When the headlights are on and in the low beam position, power is fed to the fog lights switch (414) by
            way of circuit 64B. When the fog lights switch (414) is moved to the on position, power is applied to
            circuit 64A and the coil of the fog light relay (440).
        </para>
        <para>This energizes the relay, which is grounded through circuit 64-GA, connector (78), circuits 64-GB and
            64-GC to G3 ground adapter (456) on vehicles without Canadian DRL. On vehicles with Canadian DRL, the fog
            light relay is grounded through circuit 64-GA, connector (78), circuit 64-GA, DRL night relay (474), and
            circuits 66-GC, 66-GB and 66-GA to G6 ground adapter (616). With the relay energized, power flows from A3
            accessories adapter (593) through circuit 12P, 20A fuse F10-A, circuit 64, N.O. relay contacts, circuit 64D,
            connector (125), circuit 64P, connector (155), and circuit 64P to a splice. From the splice power flows
            through circuit 64E, left fog light connector (156), and a black wire to the left fog light and through
            circuit 64H, right fog light connector (157), and a black wire to the right fog light.
        </para>
        <para>The left fog light is grounded through a white wire, the left fog light connector (156), circuits 11BX and
            11BW, connector (155), and circuit 11-GW to frame ground (J11). The right fog light is grounded through a
            white wire, the right fog light connector (157), circuits 11BY and 11BW, connector (155), and circuit 11-GW
            to frame ground (J11).
