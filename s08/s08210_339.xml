        <para>When the left luggage compartment mercury switch is closed, power flows from battery stud (B2) through
            circuits 14AK, 14AP, fuse F8 - D, circuits 63AA, 63AB, and 63AJ to the left mercury switch. Then power flows
            through circuits 63AK, and 63AL to the left lamp. If the right luggage compartment mercury switch is closed,
            power will also flow through 63AB, but additionally it will flow through circuit 63AD to the right mercury
            switch. Then power flows through circuit 63AE to the right lamp. When the center luggage compartment lift-up
            bunk switch is closed, power flows from battery stud (B2) through circuits 14AK, 14AP, fuse F8 - D, circuits
            63AA, 63AB, and 63AG to the center lift-up bunk switch. Then power flows through circuits 63AM, and 63AN to
            the center lamp. The ground path for the left light is circuits 63-GAK, 11-GBC and 11-GBD to ground adapter
            (454). The ground path for the right light is circuits 63-GD, 11-GAG, 11-GBC and 11-GBD to ground adapter
            (454). The ground path for the center light is circuits 63-GAN, 11-GBC and 11-GBD to ground adapter (454).
