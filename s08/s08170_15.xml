                            <para>A WIRE FROM VEHICLE IGNITION SWITCH TO TERMINAL #1 IS NORMALLY USED. IF NO WIRE IS
                                ATTACHED FROM IGNITION SWITCH TO THIS TERMINAL, A JUMPER TO TERMINAL #13 WOULD BE
                                REQUIRED. WHEN WIRE FROM IGNITION SWITCH IS ATTACHED, IT MUST GO ON AND OFF WITH
                                IGNITION AND HAVE 12 VOLTS WHEN ON. THE ALTERNATOR WILL NOT OPERATE WITH BOTH A JUMPER
                                AND THE IGNITION WIRE ATTACHED TO TERMINAL #1. USE ONE OR THE OTHER.
