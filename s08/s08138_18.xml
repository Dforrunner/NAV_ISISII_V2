            <para>The troubleshooting guide requires checking specific connectors. Use the following steps to determine
                if the connector is causing the problem. If a defective condition is found, make the necessary
                corrections and continue the process.

                    Each terminal/wire assembly should easily withstand 10 pounds of pull and remain in the connector.
                    This test determines (A) if the wire is properly in the terminal and (B) if the terminal is properly
                    inserted into the connector. Correct any defects noted.

                    mating side of the connector, using a new female terminal for the test.

                Deutsch 40-Pin connector, with the International side having female terminals (sockets) and the
                Caterpillar side having pins.

            <para>When replacing electrical switches, connectors (including pins and sockets), relays or other
                components, use only approved International replacement parts. Many of the switches have gold or silver
                plated contacts and some of the connectors have gold plated terminals. By using correct replacement
                parts, you maintain the design integrity of the system.
