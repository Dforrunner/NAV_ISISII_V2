        <title>NEUTRAL START SWITCH FUNCTION</title>
        <para>The neutral start function is controlled by the WT ECU using the neutral start relay located in the VIM,
            to control "start" voltage from the start switch to the starter magnetic switch.
        </para>
        <para>When the key is turned to the START POSITION, power from the key switch (24), is sent to terminal 30
            (common) of the NEUTRAL START RELAY located in the VIM. If the WT ECU determines that the transmission is in
            neutral, 12V from the ECU will be applied to the control coil (terminal 86) of the NEUTRAL START RELAY
            causing the relay to energize.
        </para>
        <para>With the NEUTRAL START RELAY energized, power from relay terminal 87 is delivered to the starter magnetic
            switch.
        </para>
        <para>To summarize the neutral start system: With the transmission in neutral, voltage from the ECU energizes
            the Neutral start relay, which closes delivering voltage from the "S" terminal of the key switch through the
            neutral start relay to energize the starter magnetic switch.
