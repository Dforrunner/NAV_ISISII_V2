                When the optional engine fan override switch is not installed, the ECM applies 12 volts on circuit 23A
                from ECM connector (1093) terminal 28 circuit 23D to the fan solenoid (227), causing the solenoid to
                energize, turning off the air pressure that keeps the fan engaged. The fan is spring loaded in the
                disengaged position. The solenoid is grounded through circuit 23-GA and 11-GC.

            <para>When the optional engine fan override switch is installed, the solenoid is energized by 12 volts on
                circuit 23A from ECM connector (1093) terminal 28 through switch (659), which then applies the voltage
                on circuit 23D to the fan solenoid (227), causing the solenoid to energize, turning off the air pressure
                that keeps the fan engaged. The fan is spring loaded in the disengaged position. The solenoid is

            <para>The engine fan override switch has an indicator lamp which will light, during the time the fan would
                normally be off, when the override switch is on. The 12V signal on circuit 23A from ECM connector (400)
                terminal 28 will flow through the LED in switch (659). The LED is grounded through circuit 23-GY.

            <para>The engine fan override switch is illuminated with an LED. 12 volts from the panel feed adapter (503)
                is supplied on circuit 62M. Ground for the LED is supplied on circuit 11-GR.

                The fan is turned on two ways:

            <seqlist>
                <item>
                    <para>When the ECM senses the engine coolant has reached the preset temperature limit, the ECM turns
                        off the voltage to circuit 23D. This causes the fan solenoid to de-energize, which applies air
                        pressure to the fan clutch engaging the fan.
                    </para>
                </item>
                <item>
                    <para>The second way the fan is turned on is when the A/C compressor head pressure exceeds 300 psi,
                        the A/C high pressure switch (228) opens the fan solenoid circuit. This causes the fan solenoid
                        to de-energize, which applies air pressure to the fan clutch engaging the fan. When the A/C head
                        pressure drops below 210 psi, the switch closes, energizing the fan solenoid and the fan turns
                        off.

                The ECM applies 12 volts through the 21-way ECM interface connector (251) to circuit 23A, which is
                connected to the normally closed A/C high pressure switch (228), which then applies the voltage on
                circuit 23D to the fan solenoid (227), causing the solenoid to energize, turning on the air pressure
                which overrides the fan clutch spring, turning the fan off.
