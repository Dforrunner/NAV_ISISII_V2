        <title>SENSOR INPUT TO PT PACER UNIT</title>
        <svcprocinfo>
            <para>The PCU receives AC (alternating current) signals from the vehicle speed sensor (speedometer) and the
                engine speed sensor (tachometer). Both are dual coil sensors and have two leads. Even though the
                resistance in a sensor's two coils is different, the leads are interchangeable. The resistance in one
                coil is between 900-1100 ohms and the other coil is between 1200-1450 ohms.

            <title>Vehicle Speed Sensor</title>
            <para>The vehicle speed sensor is located on the rear of the transmission. The sensor is a permanent magnet
                and as the speedometer gear rotates, the gear teeth break the magnetic field. This creates the AC
                voltage. One lead from the sensor connects to the PCU harness and the other lead connects to the engine
                harness speedometer circuits.

            <title>Engine Speed Sensor</title>
            <para>The engine speed sensor is located in the engine flywheel housing and the sensor's magnetic field is
                broken by the flywheel teeth. One lead connects to the PCU harness and the other connects to the engine
                harness tachometer circuits.
