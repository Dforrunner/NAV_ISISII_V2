        <title>Luggage Compartment Lights With PRO SLEEPER</title>
        <para>When the left luggage compartment switch is closed, power flows from battery stud (B2) through circuits
            14AK, 14AP, fuse F8 - D, circuits 63AA, 63AB, and 63AJ to the left luggage compartment light switch. Then
            power flows through circuits 63AK, and 63AL to the left lamp. If the right luggage compartment light switch
            is closed, power will also flow through 63AB, but additionally it will flow through circuit 63AD to the
            right luggage compartment light switch. Then power flows through circuit 63AE to the right lamp. The ground
            path for the left light is circuits 63-GAK, 11-GAF, 11-GBC, 11-GBD and 11-GBE to ground adapter (454). The
            ground path for the right light is circuits 63-GD, 11-GAG, 11-GBC, 11-GBD and 11-GBE to ground adapter
            (454).
