            <para>The Speedo/Tach module performs self-diagnostics at power up for the gauge circuits and sensors. The
                Speedo/Tach module uses gauge pointer movement and the alarm to communicate the faults to the driver or
                service technician. The alarm and pointer movements used to communicate conditions are:
