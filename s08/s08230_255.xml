        <title>Stop Light Switch, With Hydraulic Brakes</title>
        <para>Power is applied from battery feed block (J1) to circuit 14A, fuse F9, and circuit 70 to the stop light
            switch (51). Applying the brakes closes the switch contacts and applies power through circuit 70C/70E to the
            stop light relay (660). The relay coil ground path is through circuit 97-GH/11-GN which energizes the relay.
        </para>
        <para>Voltage is also applied from fuse F9 through circuit 70A to the stop light relay (660). With the relay
            energized, power is supplied through the relay switch contacts and circuit 70B to the turn signal switch
            (459). From the turn signal switch, power for the left stop light is applied through circuit 56D/56DS,
            junction block connector (182) and circuit 56F to dash connector (13). Power for the right stop light is
            applied through circuit 57D/57DS, junction block connector (182) and circuit 57F to dash connector (13).
            From the dash connector, power is supplied to the left rear stop light through a yellow wire and to the
            right rear stop light through a green wire. The stop/tail lights are grounded through a white wire to the
            frame.
