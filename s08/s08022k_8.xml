        <title>DEEP CYCLE BATTERIES</title>
        <para>Deep cycle (auxiliary) batteries are designed to deliver low rates of current for long periods of time.
            Deep cycle batteries are used to provide electrical power to the accessories when the engine is not running.
            In this application, the battery is in a very low state of charge before it is recharged. Deep cycle
            batteries are built with thicker positive grids, denser positive paste, and different negative plate alloys
            to resist failure due to the high temperature that is generated when recharging a very low battery.
