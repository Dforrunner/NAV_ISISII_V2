            <para>Vehicle batteries are connected in parallel with the positive battery cable connected to the cranking
                motor solenoid "B" terminal. Depending upon battery box location, some vehicles have two positive cables
                to the cranking motor. The additional cable reduces the voltage drop during cranking.
            </para>
            <para>The negative battery terminals are connected to the cranking motor ground terminal, which is connected
                to the frame rail. The engine and cab are also connected by ground cables to the cranking motor ground.
            </para>
            <para>An optional 3 +1 isolated battery system is available. Refer to POWER DISTRIBUTION AND GROUND SYSTEM
                for this system.
