        <title>ALARM</title>
        <para>A single electronically driven alarm is mounted on and plugs into the Speedo/Tach module. The alarm is a
            replaceable item. The alarm generates different tone sequences to alert the driver or service technician to
            the current alarm condition. The alarm will sound, reporting out-of-range conditions in the following
            manner:

        <step1>
            <para count="1">Low fuel - 5 short beeps and the low fuel light turns ON, and remains ON as long as the
                condition is present.
            </para>
        </step1>
        <step1>
            <para count="1">Low oil pressure - 5 short beeps and the low oil pressure light turns ON, and remains ON as

        <step1>
            <para count="1">High water temperature - 5 short beeps and the high water temperature light turns ON, and
                remains ON as long as the condition is present.
            </para>
        </step1>
        <step1>
            <para count="1">Low air pressure - the alarm sounds short beeps
                <emph type="bold">continuously</emph>and the low air pressure light turns ON, and remains ON as long as
                the condition is present.
            </para>
        </step1>
        <para>The alarm is also used in the self-diagnostics of the Speedo/Tach module. That will be discussed in
            <hotlnk document="s08035x_37.xml" xrefid="x080351a">DIAGNOSTICS</hotlnk>.

        <para>The Power Divider Lock warning system has its own optional alarm (not part of the Speedo/Tach module).
