        <title>Stop Light Switch, with Signal-Stat Turn Signal, With Truck With 4-Wheel Trailer Connections, Without
            International Engine
        </title>
        <para>Power is supplied from junction block (J1) to circuit 14A, fuse F9, circuit 70K, connector (46) and a red
            wire to air operated stop light switch (71). When the service brakes are applied, the contacts of switch
            (71) close and power is applied to a brown wire, connector (46) and circuit 70J to a splice.
        </para>
        <para>Power is also applied from fuse F9 to circuit 70 and the trailer stop light switch connector (11). When
            the trailer brakes are applied, the contacts of switch (11) close and power is applied to circuit 70A to a
            splice.
        </para>
        <para>From the splice, power is applied to circuit 70B and the turn signal switch (422), and circuit 70D to the
            stop light relay (R4). This energizes stop light relay (R4) as current flows through its coil and ground
            circuit 70-G/11-G to cab ground. With (R4) energized, power is applied from junction block (J1) to circuit
            14S/14J, fuse F29, circuit 70C and relay (R4) N.O. contacts and circuit 70F to a splice. From the splice,
            power is applied to circuit 70E and trailer connector (160) and also to circuit 70H and trailer connector
            (183) with frame mounted trailer socket.
