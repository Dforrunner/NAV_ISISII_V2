        <title>12 Volt Power Distribution (Accessory)</title>
        <para>Power is fed to key switch (24) on circuit 15 from junction block (J1). When the key switch is moved to
            the accessory position, voltage is applied to circuit 66 and to the Daytime Running Light module or relay.
            Voltage is also applied to circuit 12, going to the accessory feed block (J2). From the accessory feed block
            (J2), voltage is also applied to the power distribution fuse panel through circuits 12A and 12B.
        </para>
        <para>With International engines equipped with an alternator indicator light, voltage is also applied from the
            (J2) feed block to the alternator "I" terminal through circuit 1, bulkhead connector (2), circuit 1-RW/1A
            and circuit 1. This causes the indicator light to come on with the key in the accessory position
