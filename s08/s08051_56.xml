            <para>The vehicle batteries, connected in parallel, provide power via the positive battery cable which is
                connected to the cranking motor solenoid "B" terminal. Depending upon battery box location, some
                vehicles have two positive cables to the cranking motor.
            </para>
            <para>The negative battery terminals are connected to the cranking motor ground terminal, which is connected
                to the frame rail. The engine and cab are also connected by ground cables to the cranking motor ground.
            </para>
            <para>An optional 3+1 isolated battery system is available. Refer to POWER DISTRIBUTION AND GROUND SYSTEM
