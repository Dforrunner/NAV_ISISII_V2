        <title>Bunk Fluorescent And Reading Lights With PRO SLEEPER</title>
        <para>When the bunk dome light switch is moved at either of the two locations or the sleeper dome light switch
            is moved, current will flow from battery stud (B2), through circuit 14AP, fuse F8 - D, circuits 63AA, and
            63AP to the bunk fluorescent light. The ground circuit is 63-GJ or 63-GK between the two bunk dome light
            switches, and circuit 63-GE or 63-GF going to the sleeper dome light switch, and circuits 63-GA, 11-GAB, and
            11-GB to ground stud at right dash panel.
        </para>
        <para>When the lower bunk reading light switch is turned on, current will flow from battery stud (B2), through
            circuits 14AK, 14AP, fuse F8 - D, circuits 63AA, and 63U, 63T and 63W to the reading light switch and lamp.
            The ground circuit is 63-GW, 11-GAD and 11-GBD to ground adapter (454).
        </para>
        <para>When the upper bunk reading light switch is turned on, current will flow from battery stud (B2), through
            circuits 14AK, 14AP, fuse F8-D, circuits 63AA and 63U to the reading light switch and lamp. The ground
            circuit is 63-GU, (switch [220] and circuit 63GX with the Sky-Rise) 11-GAD and 11-GBD to ground adapter
            (454).
        </para>
        <para>In the Sky-Rise model switch (220) is opened when the upper bunk is raised. This will inhibit the upper
            bunk reading light from illuminating.
        </para>
        <para>When the under cabinet light switch is turned on, current will flow from battery stud (B2) through
            circuits 14AK, 14AP, fuse F8 - D, circuits 63AA and 63AR to the under cabinet light switch and lamp. The
            ground circuit is 63-GR, 11-GAD and 11-GBD to ground adapter (454).
