            <title>Standard System</title>
            <para>The vehicle batteries, connected in parallel, provide power via the positive battery cable which is
                connected to the cranking motor solenoid "B" terminal. The negative battery terminals are connected to
                the cranking motor ground terminal, which is connected to the frame rail. The engine and cab are also
                grounded with cables to the frame rail or alternator ground.

            <title>3+1 Isolated Battery System</title>
            <para>With the 3+1 battery system, three of the vehicle batteries are connected in parallel and provide
                power via the positive battery cable to the 7V isolated battery magnetic switch. The fourth battery is
                grounded with the other three but provides power through a cable to the other side of the magnetic
                switch and other circuits to the (B2) battery stud, thus providing continuous power to the sleeper, and
                isolating the other three batteries to reserve their power for engine cranking. The negative battery
                terminals are connected to the cranking motor ground terminal, which is connected to the frame rail. The
                engine and cab are also grounded with cables to the frame rail or alternator ground.

            <title>Remote Start Terminal</title>
            <para>An optional remote start terminal allows an external battery power source to either charge the vehicle
                batteries or assist in cranking the engine.
