        <title>INSTRUMENT CLUSTER</title>
        <para>The cluster is a reliable, quick-disconnect package for the most commonly used instruments. Should the
            need arise, the cluster body can be quickly detached from the instrument panel for quick access to any of
            its components. Either the complete cluster assembly or any of its components can be replaced.
        </para>
        <para>Always place the ignition in the OFF position (not ACC) prior to working on the cluster, due to potential
            shorting between the ground and ignition pins, which will damage the circuit board and gauges.
        </para>
        <specpara>
            <caution>
                <para>Static electricity can cause permanent damage to the cluster. Before working on the cluster, be
                    sure to remove all static electricity from your body by touching metal that is grounded. Do not wear
                    clothing that causes static electric build up (nylon).
