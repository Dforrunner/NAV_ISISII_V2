        <title>ENGINE BRAKE</title>
        <svcprocinfo>
            <para>A Series 60, DDEC controlled vehicle with an engine brake operates the same as a mechanically
                controlled vehicle with an engine brake (see Operators Manual for operating instructions). With DDEC,
                the driver controls the engine brake switches, but the system is enabled (or disabled) by the Engine
                Brake Enable Relay (326) which is controlled by the ECM. The DDEC system utilizes an "enable" relay for
                the engine brake system, rather than an engine brake control module. An Engine Brake ON/OFF switch (334)
                and Engine Brake Selector switch (221) are also part of the control system.

            <title>Engine Brake On/Off Switch (334)</title>
            <para>The ON/OFF switch is a two-pole, single-throw switch. The switch receives ignition voltage from two
                sources.
            </para>
            <para>Ignition power to energize the Engine Brake Enable Relay comes from S18 circuit breaker and through
                the closed contacts of the clutch switch (clutch pedal released) on circuit 24AK.
            </para>
            <para>Ignition power to the other pole of the ON/OFF switch comes directly from S18 circuit breaker (circuit
                24AC) and is used to energize the engine brake solenoids. A vehicle with an Antilock Brake System (ABS)
                receives ignition power to energize the engine brake solenoids from the ABS Engine Brake Relay (part of
                ABS system) on circuit 24AC. This is done so that the ABS can disable the engine brake if it senses a
                wheel skid is possible. Refer to GROUP 04 - BRAKES in the CTS-5000 Master Service Manual for circuit
                diagrams and troubleshooting information on ABS.

        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Engine Brake Enable Relay (326)</title>
            <para>The engine brake enable relay control coil receives ignition power from 15A circuit breaker S18
                through the clutch switch (pedal released) and the engine brake ON/OFF switch (ON position). The control
                coil for the relay is grounded through a diode (337) to ECM terminal (A1). The ECM energizes the Enable
                relay (326) by controlling the ground circuit at ECM terminal A1.
            </para>
            <para>The ECM enables or disables the ground by switching between 0 volts or 12 volts at terminal A1 in
                response to programmed instructions and inputs from other sensors and switches. ECM terminal A1 will be
                at ground, enabling the relay whenever there is no demand for fuel (throttle in idle position) and
                engine speed is at least 150 rpm higher than the idle setting. Cruise control must also be disabled.
            </para>
            <para>With the Engine Brake Enable Relay (326) energized, ignition power from S18 circuit breaker through
                the ON/OFF switch is delivered through the relay (common contact 30 and contact 87) and the Engine Brake
                Selector Switch (221) to energize the engine brake solenoids.
            </para>
        </svcsubproc>
        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Engine Brake Selector Switch (221)</title>
            <para>The selector switch receives ignition voltage from the enable relay on circuit 24AD when the enable
                relay is energized. The ignition power is delivered from the selector switch through the International
                installed cab, engine harness and DDEC engine brake harness (at connector 344) to the engine brake
                solenoids (engine brake solenoids are installed by Detroit Diesel).
            </para>
            <para>Note that the selector switch in the circuit diagram is in the FULL engine brake position. Ignition
                power is sent through connector 344 to DDEC circuits 621 (front solenoid) and 622 (rear solenoids).
            </para>
            <para>Placing the selector switch in the "center" position, as viewed in the circuit diagram, applies power
                to DDEC circuit 622 (rear solenoid only).
            </para>
            <para>With the selector switch in "left" position as viewed in the circuit diagram, power is applied to DDEC
                circuit 621 (front solenoid only).
