        <title>ENGINE OIL PRESSURE GAUGE, LIGHT, AND ALARM</title>
        <svcprocinfo>
            <para>The input signal to the Speedometer/Tachometer module for the engine oil pressure gauge (and warning
                light and alarm) comes from a gauge sender with mechanical engines or the ECM with electronic engines.
            </para>
        </svcprocinfo>
        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Electronic Engines</title>
            <para>The International, Caterpillar, Cummins and Detroit Diesel electronic control systems include a sensor
                to determine engine oil pressure, so the information is in the ECM.
            </para>
            <para>The ECM sends a signal in the form of a serial data transmission over the ATA data link circuit (a
                positive and negative pair of twisted wires) to the Speedometer/Tachometer module through connector
                (421). The signal is also present at the ATA data link connector and oil pressure can be read using an
                electronic service tool (EST).
            </para>
            <para>For additional information on the data link refer to GROUP 08 - ELECTRICAL, Electronic Engine
                Controls, in the CTS-5000 Master Service Manual.
            </para>

        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Mechanical Engines</title>
            <para>With mechanical engines, a 3-wire oil pressure sender (565) is installed on the engine. Circuit 35A
                supplies 4.4 volts from the Speedometer/Tachometer module to the sender at the red wire. The sender is
                grounded from the black wire on circuit 35-G to the Speedometer/Tachometer module. The sender returns a
                variable signal (0.5 volt minimum) to the Speedometer/Tachometer module on circuit 35.
            </para>
        </svcsubproc>
        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Oil Pressure Gauge</title>
            <para>The Speedometer/Tachometer module processes the signal from the sender and outputs signals to drive
                the gauge through connector (422) on circuits 35S(+), 35S(-), 35C(+) and 35C(-) to the left gauge
                cluster at connector (424). The oil pressure gauge is a 4-pin electronically driven gauge that plugs
                into the gauge cluster.
            </para>
        </svcsubproc>
        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Warning Light</title>
            <para>The oil pressure warning light should turn ON and remain on as a bulb test, while the gauges go
                through the self test process with key ON and engine OFF.
            </para>
            <para>The low oil pressure warning light in the left gauge cluster receives ignition voltage (key ON)
                through cluster connector (423) from 10A fuse F4-A. The warning light ground path is through cluster
                connector (423) on circuit 35L to the Speedometer/Tachometer module connector (422). In response to
                sensor or ECM inputs indicating low oil pressure, the module opens and closes a ground switch causing
                the light to turn ON or OFF.
            </para>
        </svcsubproc>
        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Alarm</title>
            <para>In response to sensor or ECM inputs indicating low oil pressure, the Speedometer/Tachometer module
                causes the alarm to sound. The alarm will sound five short beeps when the low oil light turns ON. The
                alarm is an internal feature of the Speedometer/Tachometer module.
            </para>
        </svcsubproc>
        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Alarm And Warning Light Trip Points</title>
            <para>The Speedometer/Tachometer module reports low oil pressure (alarm and warning light) differently with
                electronic engines than with mechanical engines. With the electronic engines, the low oil pressure
                signal comes from the engine ECM over the data link. The low oil pressure alarm and warning lights are
                turned ON and OFF by diagnostic messages provided by the International, Caterpillar, Cummins or Detroit
                Diesel ECM (engine controller).
            </para>
            <para>With mechanical engines and standard sensors, the trip point for the low oil pressure alarm and
                warning light is programmed in the Speedometer/Tachometer module by International.
