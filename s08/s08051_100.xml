        <title>TESTING HELLA RELAY</title>
        <svcprocinfo>
            <para>International circuits use suppressed Hella relays for controlling power to load devices. The
                suppression feature (a resistor circuit parallel to the relay coil) prevents voltage spikes from
                damaging electronic components in the vehicle.
                <emph type="bold">These relays must be replaced with approved International parts.</emph>
            </para>
            <para>The part number and relay circuit diagram are embossed on the relay body. The terminals are numbered
                on the relay in the same manner as in the circuit diagrams.
