        <title>Kysor Fan With Cummins M11 Or N14 With Or Without Air Conditioning</title>
        <para>The Cummins ECM controls the cooling fan clutch by supplying 12 volts to engine connector (309) pin C.
            This power is transferred through circuit 23D to connector (239) and the red wire of the fan solenoid. With
            the solenoid energized, the air supply to the fan clutch will come on, thus the fan will stop. The fan
            solenoid is grounded through the black wire and connector (239) of the solenoid, and circuits 23-GA and
            11-GU to start motor ground (J8).
        </para>
        <para>The ECM cycles the fan to regulate engine temperature and A/C compressor head refrigerant pressure. The
            ECM uses temperature sensors on the engine and input from the A/C pressure switch (240) to determine these
            on/off cycles. This input is the application of a ground signal which originates from pin 10 of ECM
            connector (263) and is applied to circuits 97-G and 23-GB, A/C switch or jumper at connector (240), circuit
            23C and engine connector (309) pin T. The A/C pressure switch is a N.C. switch that opens up at pressures
            greater the 300 psi, and thus signals the ECM, by removing the ground signal, to turn on the engine fan.
