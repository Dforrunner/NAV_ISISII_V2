            <para>The fuel shutoff valve is controlled entirely by the ECM. The valve opens providing fuel when the
                vehicle switch key is ON and closes when the key is OFF. The valve is also closed by the ECM if the
                engine speed goes above 2730 rpm. When engine speed drops below 2275, the valve opens, resuming normal
                operation.

            <title>Accelerator Pedal Assembly (242)</title>
            <para>CELECT engines use an electronic accelerator pedal assembly that provides electrical signals to the
                ECM in response to the driver's request for engine power. The assembly includes an
                <emph type="bold">Accelerator Position Sensor (APS) and an Idle Validation Switch (IVS)</emph>. The
                accelerator pedal assembly is not serviceable and if defective, must be replaced and recalibrated with
                the ECM.
            </para>
            <para>
                <emph type="bold">Accelerator Position Sensor (APS)</emph>
                - The APS is a potentiometer attached to the accelerator pedal. Movement of the pedal results in a
                variable D.C. signal being sent to the ECM. A twisted wire pair is used for this interface.
            </para>
            <para>The 5V signal from ECM connector (252) terminal 18 is applied to APS terminal C. The wiper (variable
                signal depending on pedal position) signal from APS terminal B returns to ECM terminal 11. This variable
                signal tells the ECM the position of the accelerator pedal. The APS ground is through APS terminal A to
                ECM connector (252) terminal 19.

                <note>
                    <para>Any time the accelerator pedal sensor (APS) is disconnected from the ECM with the key switch
                        ON, the APS and ECM must be recalibrated (refer to
                        <hotlnk document="s08140_15.xml" xrefid="x0814002">Accelerator/ECM Calibration</hotlnk>).

            <para>
                <emph type="bold">Idle Validation Switch (IVS)</emph>
                - The IVS is used to determine when the accelerator pedal is in the low idle position. A 5 volt signal
                from ECM connector (252) terminal 10 is applied to the IVS at terminal F. Whenever the accelerator is in
                the low idle position, the IVS returns a 5V signal to ECM connector (252) terminal 6. When the throttle
                is not in the idle position, the 5V signal is returned to ECM connector (252) terminal 9.

            <title>Vehicle Speed Sensor (VSS)</title>
            <para>The VSS is located in the rear of the transmission housing. The VSS has two coils and two leads. One
                coil is connected to the International engine harness at connector (250) and transmits the signal
                through ECM connector (252) to the ECM. The other sensor lead is connected to the chassis harness at
                connector (88) and the signal goes through the chassis and cab harness to the vehicle speedometer unit.
            </para>
            <para>The resistance of the two sensor coils is different. One coil should be 900-1100 ohms and the other
                coil should be 1250-1400 ohms. The two sensor leads are interchangeable.
