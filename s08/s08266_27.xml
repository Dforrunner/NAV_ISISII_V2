        <svcsubproc>
            <title>ECM Power and Ground</title>
            <para>The Electronic Control Module (ECM) receives 12 volt operating power, with the key switch in the
                ignition position, from the ECM power relay. The circuitry is protected by a 40 amp fuse that is part of
                the battery cable assembly. The control module ground is to the negative post of the batteries.
            </para>

        <svcsubproc>
            <title>APS/IVS</title>
            <para>The Accelerator Pedal Position Sensor (APS) is a potentiometer type sensor which, when supplied with a
                5 volt reference signal from the Electronic Control Module (ECM), provides a linear analog voltage
                signal that indicates the driver's demand for power. The APS signal is used in calculating desired fuel
                quantity and injector timing.
            </para>
            <para>The Idle Validation Switch (IVS) is a 0/12 volt switch that provides the ECM with a redundant signal
                to verify when the pedal is in the idle position.
            </para>
            <para>These two functions are integrated into one component mounted on the accelerator pedal. The pedal
                assembly is serviceable to the extent that the APS/IVS can be replaced without replacing the complete
                pedal.
            </para>
        </svcsubproc>
        <svcsubproc>
            <title>BAP</title>
            <para>The Barometric Air Pressure sensor (BAP) is a variable capacitance sensor, that when supplied with a 5
                volt reference signal from the ECM, produces a linear analog voltage signal that varies with altitude.
                The BAP signal is used by the ECM to adjust timing and fuel quantity, to optimize engine operation and
                control smoke throughout all altitude conditions.
            </para>
        </svcsubproc>
        <svcsubproc>
            <title>ATS</title>
            <para>The ambient Air Temperature Sensor (ATS) is a thermistor type sensor that has a variable resistance
                which changes when exposed to different temperatures. The ECM measures the signal from the sensor and
                uses the data to adjust timing and fuel rate to limit smoke emissions in cold weather starting.
            </para>
        </svcsubproc>
        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Cruise Control/PTO System</title>
            <para>The Cruise/PTO system feature controls engine and vehicle speed using automotive style set/coast,
                resume/accel, ON/OFF switches and is controlled by the ECM. Speed control is disabled when the OFF
                switch is depressed, the brake is applied or the automatic transmission is placed in neutral.
            </para>
            <para>The Vehicle Speed Sensor (VSS) and the Camshaft Position sensor (CMP) provide vehicle speed and engine
                RPM signals to the ECM. This information is also used by the ECM to control the Cruise/PTO system.
            </para>
            <para>The cruise control switches and circuitry are also used for in-bus cab control of preset, variable,
                and mobile PTO operation applications and require programming of the engine ECM.
            </para>
            <para>For information on remote PTO control for body builder applications, refer to Miscellaneous
                Information in CT-471 Body Builder Book.

        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Radiator Shutters and Fans</title>
            <para>The function of the radiator shutters and fans are to keep the operating temperature of the engine in
                the optimum range. The engine ECM controls the opening and closing of the shutters based on signals
                received from the engine coolant temperature sensor. The fan is turned ON and OFF when the ECM senses
                the engine coolant has reached the preset temperature limit or when the A/C compressor head pressure
                exceeds a preset limit.
