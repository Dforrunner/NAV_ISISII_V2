            <title>Hydraulic Brake System</title>
            <para>The Hydro-Max II hydraulic brake system uses hydraulic pressure from the power steering pump. If the
                flow is inadequate or interrupted, the monitor module is fed a signal from the flow switch, causing the
                monitor to turn on a brake warning light and alarm and start the hydraulic reserve pump to provide
                additional braking power. The reserve pump and brake warning system are also activated when the
                differential pressure switch (301) is tripped due to a pressure loss in one half of the brake system.
            </para>
            <para>When key switch (63) is in the ignition or start position, power is supplied through circuit 13C to
                the ignition relay (4G). The relay is grounded through circuit circuit 13-G/11-GB to cab ground. This
                energizes the relay and switches battery power from circuit 15D, through the closed relay contacts and
                circuit 13 to circuit breaker F9. From the circuit breaker, power is supplied through circuit 90U, brake
                diode connector (47), and a blocking diode assembly (48). From the diode assembly, power is supplied to
                circuit 90H, dash connector (2), circuit 90H, and the hydraulic brake relay (300). From the diode
                assembly, power is also applied to circuit 90F and the brake monitor module (49). The brake monitor
                module (49) is grounded through circuits 90-G/11-GA to cab ground.
            </para>
            <para>Battery power is applied to fusible link circuit through circuit 90-FL/90/90B, dash connector (2),
                circuit 90B, fuse F21, and circuit 90C to the hydraulic brake switch (50).
            </para>
            <para>When the key switch is moved to the start or ignition position, the flow switch (381) contacts will be
                closed (engine is not running). A ground path is provided from the crank motor ground stud through
                circuit 11-GJ/90-G, flow switch connector (381), the switch, circuit 90R/90L, differential pressure
                switch connector (301), and circuit 90K to a splice.
            </para>
            <para>From the splice, a ground path is provided through circuit 90M, dash connector (2), and circuit 90M to
                the brake monitor module alarm input (49-A). This causes the module to switch the alarm output (49-C) to
                ground which activates the warning system. From the splice, a ground circuit is also provided by way of
                circuit 90J to the hydraulic brake relay (300), causing it to energize. With the relay energized, power
                flows through the N.C. contacts and circuit 90N to the reserve pump motor. This causes the reserve pump
                motor, which is grounded through its case, to run and provide additional brake power (fluid flow).
            </para>
            <para>The monitor module continuously monitors the continuity of the reserve pump motor and its power supply
                through circuit 90P, dash connector (2) and circuit 90P. An alarm and warning light will activate if the
                pump motor winding opens up, if the hydraulic brake relay (300) remains closed (provides power to
                circuit 90N and the reserve pump motor) after the engine is running and the flow switch opens up, or if
                no power is supplied to the pump motor when the flow switch or differential pressure switch contacts are
                closed.
            </para>
            <para>When the brake monitor module switches its alarm output (49-C) to ground, the brake warning light and
                alarm are activated by power flowing through cluster connector (27), the light, cluster connector (28),
                and circuit 90T to the module.
            </para>
            <para>If the ignition key is in the off position and the truck brakes are applied, the contacts of the
                hydraulic brake switch (50) close. With the contacts closed, power flows through circuit 90D, connector
                (47), blocking diode assembly (48), connector (47) and circuit 90F to feed the brake monitor module at
                connector (49-E). From connector (47), power is also supplied to circuit 90E and the brake monitor
                module (49-G). This signal is compared to a signal provided from stop light switch (51) and circuit
                70B/90R to brake monitor module (49-H). If there is a voltage on just one of the two circuits, 90E or
                90R, for longer than 14 &#177; 5 seconds, the warning light and alarm will be turned on.
            </para>
            <para>When the brakes are applied, the brake switch (50) also applies voltage to circuit 97M, dash connector
                (3) and circuit 97M to the ECM. This signals the ECM that the brakes have been applied.

            <title>Heated Fuel Filter - 1152SC, 1552SC</title>
            <para>Power is applied from the cowl junction feed stud to circuit 14H, fuse F37 and circuit 19, to the fuel
                heater relay (590A). When the key switch (63) is placed in the ignition or start position, power is also
                applied through circuit breaker F16 and 19H/19E to the fuel heater relay coil. The relay is energized
                through ground circuit 19-G/11-GJ to the crank motor ground stud.
            </para>
            <para>With the relay energized, power flows through its contacts and circuit 19D/19A to the fuel filter
                heater. The ground path is through the filter housing and its mounting bracket. When the temperature is
                45&#176;F (7&#176;C) or less, the fuel filter heater switch contacts close and cause the heater element
                to activate.
            </para>
        </svcsubproc>
        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Heated Fuel Filter - 1652SC</title>
            <para>Power is applied from the cowl junction feed stud to circuit 14K and ignition relay (R20). When key
                switch (63) is in the ignition or start position, power is supplied through circuit breaker F16, circuit
                13E/13F, dash connector (2), and circuit 13F to the ignition relay coil. The relay is energized through
                ground circuit 19-G/11-GJ to the crank motor ground stud.
            </para>
            <para>With the ignition relay energized, power flows through the closed contacts and circuit 19/92 to fuse
                F37. From the fuse, power is supplied through circuit 19D, the fuel filter heater connector (401) and
                circuit 19A to the fuel filter heater. The ground path is through the filter housing and its mounting
                bracket. When the temperature is 45&#176;F ( 7&#176;C) or less, the fuel filter heater switch contacts
                close and cause the heater element to activate.
            </para>
        </svcsubproc>
        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Water-In-Fuel Light</title>
            <para>With the key on, power is supplied through circuit breaker F16, circuit 19H/19K to the water-in-fuel
                module (470). From the module, power is applied through circuit 19C, dash connector (2), and circuit 19C
                [19C, dash connector (2), circuit 19C, fuel filter connector (401) and circuit 19C with 1652SC], to the
                fuel filter water probe.
            </para>
            <para>The ground path for the water-in-fuel module (470) is not a dedicated circuit. The fuel filter housing
                is grounded through its mounting bracket and whenever water builds up to an unacceptable level in the
                filter, the water completes the circuit between the probe contacts and the housing. This energizes the
                water-in-fuel module.
            </para>
            <para>When the water-in-fuel module becomes energized, power is applied through circuit 19L and cluster
                connector (28) to the water-in-fuel light. This energizes the lamp as power flows through the lamp,
                cluster connector (27) and circuit 28-GB/11-GA to the cab ground stud (2G).
            </para>
        </svcsubproc>
        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Fuel Filter Restriction Light</title>
            <para>With the key switch (63) in the ignition or start position, power is applied through circuit breaker
                F13, circuit 28 and cluster connector (28) to the fuel filter light. From the light, power is applied
                through cluster connector (28), circuit 19B, dash connector (2) and circuit 19B [circuit 19B, fuel
                filter connector (401), and circuit 19B with 1652SC] to the fuel filter vacuum switch. When the fuel
                filter becomes restricted, the fuel filter vacuum switch contacts close, completing a ground path and
                causing the fuel filter light to come on.
            </para>
        </svcsubproc>
        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Suspension Low Air Pressure Warning</title>
            <para>With key switch (63) in the ignition position, power is applied through circuit breaker F15, circuit
                61 to the low air alarm (474), and circuit 61A, the air dump solenoid connector (475) and to the air
                dump solenoid. The solenoid is grounded through a circuit to connector (475) and circuit 61-G/11-GB to
                cab ground (2G). This activates the solenoid and prevents air from being inadvertently released from the
                air dump control valve while the key is on.
            </para>
            <para>With the key switch on, power is also supplied through circuit breaker F13, circuit 28 and dash
                connector (27) to the suspension low air warning light. From the warning light, power is supplied
                through cluster harness connector (28) and circuit 40A to the low air alarm (474). From the alarm, power
                is supplied through circuit 40, air dump solenoid connector (475) and a circuit to the suspension low
                air pressure switch. When the system detects low air pressure, the switch contacts close which completes
                the circuit through a ground circuit to connector (475) and circuit 61-G/11-GB to cab ground (2G). This
                activates the alarm and warning light system.

        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Non-Electronic Allison Automatic Transmission - 1652SC</title>
            <para>When key switch (63) is moved to the start or ignition position, power is fed through the energized
                ignition relay (R20), circuit 19/92 to fuse F36. From the fuse, power is supplied to circuit 92D,
                engine/transmission harness connector (402) and circuit 92D/92E to the modulator solenoid relay (403)
                coil. Power is also fed from a splice in circuit 92D/92E through circuit 92B to the modulator solenoid
                relay contacts. The modulator solenoid relay is energized when ECM (379) applies a ground to circuit
                92F, engine/transmission harness connector (402), and circuit 92F.
            </para>
            <para>When the ECM commands a transmission shift, the relay coil ground is removed by the ECM which
                de-energizes the relay. With the the modulator solenoid relay de-energized, power flows through the
                contacts, circuit 92C, engine/transmission harness connector (402), circuit 92C, jumper harness
                connector (389) and circuit 92C to the modulator shift solenoid (404). The ground for the solenoid is
                circuit 92-G, connector (389) and circuit 92-G/11-GJ to the crank motor ground stud. This causes the
                shift to occur.
            </para>
            <para>With the key switch in the start or ignition position, power is also applied through circuit breaker
                F9, circuit 97P, dash connector (2), circuit 97P, and the modulator shift solenoid connector (438) to
                the neutral position switch. Providing the transmission is in neutral, power flows through the switch,
                connector (438), circuit 97AU, dash connector (2), and circuit 97AU to the ECM (379) and the crank
                inhibit relay (4H) system. This allows the crank motor to be engaged.
