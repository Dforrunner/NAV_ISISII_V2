        <title>Clearance/Marker and Tail Lights With Tractor or Truck and International Engine</title>
        <para>Battery power is applied to junction block (J1), circuit 14E, fuse F24, circuit 50A, and headlight switch
            (35). When the headlight switch is moved to the park light or headlight position, power flows through
            circuit 62 to the panel light dimmer control and circuit 58A to energize relay (R2). The ground path for
            (R2) without an interrupt switch is through circuit 58-GA, connector (202), and a white wire to cab ground.
            The ground path with interrupt switch (32) is through circuit 58-G, interrupt switch (32), circuit 58-GB,
            and circuit 11-GA/11-GF to cab ground.
        </para>
        <para>When relay (R2) is energized, power flows from junction block (J1), circuit 14A, fuse F8, circuit 58,
            relay (R2), and circuit 58B to a splice. From the splice, power flows through circuit 58D, connector (2),
            circuit 58D, connector (425), circuit 58D, circuit 58E and the left marker/turn light (503). With Canadian
            DRL, the ground circuit is circuits 11-GD, 11-GB, connector (425), circuits 11-GB and 11-GJ to starter
            ground. With USA DRL, the ground circuit is circuits 11-GD, 11-GC, 11-GB, connector (425), circuit 11-GB,
            and 11-GJ to starter ground.
        </para>
        <para>Power also flows through circuit 58D, connector (2), circuit 58D, connector (425), and circuit 58D to
            circuit 58F and the right marker/turn light (505). The ground path is circuits 11-GF, 11-GE, 11-GB, conn.
            (425), circuit 11-GB and 11-GJ to starter ground.
        </para>
        <para>With additional pedestal marker/turn lights, power also flows through circuit 58D, connector (2), circuit
            58D, connector (425) circuit 58D to a splice. From the splice power is fed to the left pedestal lamp on
            circuit 58H, and the right lamp on circuit 58J. Ground for the left lamp is 11-GG and 11-GB to cab ground
            and for the right lamp it is 11-GH and 11-GB to cab ground.
        </para>
        <para>From the splice, power is also fed to connector (13) for trailer marker lights over circuit 58E, connector
            (183) and circuit 58E.
        </para>
        <para>From circuit 58 and the splice, power also flows through circuit 68, connector (13), and a brown wire to
            the left tail light and a brown wire to the right tail light. Both lights are grounded through white wires
            to frame ground.
        </para>
        <para>With frame mounted 7-way trailer socket or owner/operator package, power flowing from circuit 58B and the
            splice also flows to circuit 68C and the trailer connector junction block (182).
        </para>
        <para>From circuit 58B and the splice, power also flows through circuit 58C, connector (19), circuit 58C,
            connector (15), and circuits 58C, 58C1, 58C2, 58C3, and 58C4 to the cab clearance and marker lights. The
            ground path is circuits 58-GC1, 58-GC2, 58-GC3, 58-GC4, and 58-GC, connector (15), circuit 58-GC, connector
            (19), circuit 58-GC, and 11-G to cab ground.
        </para>
        <para>With tractors only, power flowing from circuit 58B and the splice is also supplied to the trailer socket
            connector on circuits 68A and 68B.
