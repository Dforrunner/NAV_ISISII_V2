        <title>BRUSHES AND HOLDERS</title>
        <para>Inspect the brushes for wear. If they are worn excessively when compared with a new brush, they should be
            replaced. Make sure the brush holders are clean and the brushes are not binding in the holders. The full
            brush surface should ride on the commutator to give proper performance. Check by hand to insure that the
            brush springs are giving firm contact between the brushes and commutator. If the springs are distorted or
            discolored, the should be replaced.
