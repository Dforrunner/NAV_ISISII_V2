            <para>Refer to 12V POWER DISTRIBUTION - 3+1 BATTERY SYSTEM circuit diagram, in CTS-5119W or CTS-5273W for
                the following discussion. The 3+1 battery system includes three cranking batteries and one deep cycle
                battery. The purpose of this system is to prevent discharging the three cranking batteries while
                operating certain electrical accessories connected to (B2), off the fourth battery, when the engine is
                not running.

            <title>Engine Running Mode</title>
            <para>With the engine running, power (7 volts) from the alternator "R" terminal energizes the isolated
                battery magnetic switch, closing the contacts. This links the positive terminal of the deep cycle and
                cranking motor batteries, recharging all four batteries and supplying power from all four batteries to
                both the (B1) and (B2) battery studs.

            <para>The deep cycle battery supplies power to the (B2) battery stud. Refer to 12V POWER DISTRIBUTION - 3+1
                BATTERY SYSTEM circuit diagram, in CTS-5119W or CTS-5273W for components receiving power from the (B2)
                stud.

            <para>If the key switch is in the on or accessory position with the engine off, refer to 12V POWER
                DISTRIBUTION - ACCESSORY and 12V POWER DISTRIBUTION - IGNITION in CTS-5119W or CTS-5273W for power
                distribution.
