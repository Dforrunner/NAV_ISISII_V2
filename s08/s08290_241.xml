        <title>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION</title>
        <para>When the door open switch is closed the electronic system controller will supply a ground signal on
            connector (1600) pin 11. This will allow voltage from fuse #30 to charge the open service door relay. The
            charged relay will allow voltage from fuse #30 to power the door motor to open the service door.
        </para>
        <para>When the door close switch is closed the electronic system controller will supply a ground signal on the
            system controller connector (1602) pin 17. This will allow voltage from fuse #30 to charge the close service
            door relay. The charged relay will allow voltage from fuse #30 to power the door motor to close the service
            door.
        </para>
        <para>The step light relay is charged whenever the service door open switch is closed. The ground signal
            supplied on system controller connector (1600) pin 11 will charge the step light relay with voltage from
            fuse #30. Voltage from the step light power source will then be applied to the step light turning it on. The
            step light will remain on until the close service door circuits are activated.
        </para>
        <para>The vandal lock key switch bypasses the electronic system controller by applying a ground to the open
            service door circuits or close service door circuits, depending on which direction the key switch is turned.
            This allows for the electronic service door to be opened or closed without the key in the ignition switch.
        </para>
        <para>Ground is supplied to the service door motor through internal connections.</para>
        <para>Ground is supplied to the vandal lock key switch from the dash ground stud.</para>
