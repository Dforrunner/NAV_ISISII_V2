            <title>Air Dryer</title>
            <para>When the key switch (63) is placed in the ignition or accessory position, power is applied to circuit
                12, fuse D1, circuit 39/39A, connector (2), and a black wire to the air dryer. The ground path is
                through a white wire to cab ground.
            </para>
            <para>If the air dryer thermostat senses air temperature below 50 &#176;F, its contacts will close allowing
                current to flow through the heating element. When the thermostat senses a temperature of 85&#176;F, the
                contacts will open, interrupting the current flow.

            <title>Non-Electronic Allison Automatic Transmission</title>
            <para>When key switch (63) is moved to the start or ignition position, power is fed to fuse G1, circuit 92D,
                connector (2), circuit 92D and connector (402) with 3800 or 4000FBC, circuit 92D/92E to the modulator
                solenoid relay (403) coil. Power is also fed from a splice in circuit 92D/92E through circuit 92B to the
                modulator solenoid relay (403) contacts.
            </para>
            <para>The modulator solenoid relay (403) is energized when ECM (379) applies a ground to circuit 92F,
                connector (402), and circuit 92F.
            </para>
            <para>When the ECM commands a transmission shift, the relay coil ground is removed by the ECM which
                de-energizes the relay. With the modulator solenoid relay de-energized, power flows through circuit 92C,
                relay connector (402) and circuit 92C with 3800 or 4000FBC, connector (389), and circuit 92C to the
                modulator shift solenoid (404). This causes the shift to occur.
            </para>
            <para>The ground path for the modulator shift solenoid is circuit 92-G, connector (389), circuit 92-G/11-GJ
                to starting motor ground.
            </para>
            <para>When the key switch (63) is moved to the start or ignition position, power is also applied to circuit
                13F, fuse H1, circuit 97P, connector (2), circuit 97P, and connector (438) to the neutral position
                switch. If the transmission is in neutral, power flows through the switch, connector (438), circuit
                97AU, connector (2), and circuit 97AU to the ECM (379) and the crank inhibit relay (661) system.

            <title>Hydraulic Brake System</title>
            <para>The Hydro-Max II hydraulic brake system uses hydraulic pressure from the power steering pump. If the
                flow is inadequate or interrupted, the monitor module is fed a signal from the flow switch, causing the
                monitor to turn on a brake warning light and start the hydraulic reserve pump to provide additional
                braking power. The reserve pump and brake warning light are also activated when the differential
                pressure switch (301) is tripped due to a pressure loss in one half of the brake system.
            </para>
            <para>When key switch (63) is in the ignition or start position, power is supplied to circuit 13, fuse A1,
                circuits 13B and 90U, connector (47), and a blocking diode assembly (48). From the blocking diode
                assembly (48), power is supplied to circuit 90H, connector (2), circuit 90H, and the hydraulic brake
                relay (300). From the diode, power is also applied to circuit 90F and the brake monitor module (49). The
                brake monitor module (49) is grounded through circuits 90-G/11-G to cab ground.
            </para>
            <para>Battery power is applied to fusible link circuit 90-FL/90/90A and hydraulic brake booster relay (300).
                Power is also supplied through circuit 90-FL/90/90B, dash connector (2), circuit 90B, fuse E3, and
                circuit 90C to the hydraulic brake switch (50).
            </para>
            <para>When the key switch (63) is moved to the start or ignition position, the flow switch contacts will be
                closed (engine is not running) and a ground path is provided from the cranking motor circuit 11-GJ/90-G,
                flow switch connector (763), the switch, over circuit 90R/90L, differential pressure switch connector
                (301), and circuit 90K to a splice. From the splice, a ground path is provided over circuit 90M,
                connector (2), and circuit 90M to the brake monitor module (49) alarm input (49-A). This causes the
                module to switch the alarm output (49-C) to ground which activates the warning light. From the splice, a
                ground circuit is also provided by way of circuit 90J to the hydraulic brake relay (300), causing it to
                energize. With relay (300) energized, power flows through the N.C. contacts and circuit 90N to the
                reserve pump motor. This causes the reserve pump motor, which is grounded through its case, to run and
                provide additional brake power (fluid flow).
            </para>
            <para>A signal path, circuit 90P, connector (2) and circuit 90P to brake monitor module connector (49-F)
                provides information to the module. The module continuously monitors the continuity of the reserve pump
                motor and its power supply. This triggers the alarm and warning light if the pump motor winding opens
                up, if the hydraulic brake relay (300) remains closed (provides power to circuit 90N and the reserve
                pump motor) after the engine is running and the flow switch opens up, or if no power is supplied to the
                pump motor when the flow switch or differential pressure switch contacts are closed.
            </para>
            <para>When the brake monitor module switches its alarm output (49-C) to ground, the brake warning light
                illuminates by power flowing to the lamp feed connector (28) through the light, connector (26), and
                circuit 90T to the module at connector (49-C).
            </para>
            <para>The alarm also sounds by power flowing to the B+ terminal of the alarm, through the alarm, and circuit
                90S to the module at connector (49-C).
            </para>
            <para>If the ignition key is in the off position and the truck brakes are applied, the contacts of the
                hydraulic brake switch (50) close. With the contacts closed, power flows through circuit 90D, connector
                (47), blocking diode assembly (48), connector (47) and circuit 90F to feed the brake monitor module at
                connector (49-E). At the same time a power signal is fed from switch (50) to circuit 90D, 90E, and the
                brake monitor module (49-G). This signal is compared to a signal provided from stop light switch (51)
                and circuit 70C/90R to brake monitor module (49-H). If there is a voltage on just one of the two
                circuits 90E or 90R for longer than 14&#177;5 seconds, the warning light and alarm will be turned on.
            </para>
            <para>When the brakes are applied, the brake switch (50) also applies voltage to circuit 97M, dash connector
                (3) and circuit 97M to the ECM. This signals the ECM that the brakes have been applied.

            <title>Heated Drain Valve</title>
            <para>When the key switch (63) is placed in the start or ignition position, power is fed to circuit 12, fuse
                D1, circuit 39/93, an inline connector, circuit 39B, a black wire, and an inline single connector to the
                heated drain valve.

                <emph type="bold">Heated Fuel Filter</emph>
            </para>
            <para>Power is applied from the battery feed stud (J1) to circuit 14B, fuse D2, circuit 19D, connector (399)
                and circuit 19E to the fuel heater relay (431). When the key switch (63) is placed in the ignition or
                start position, power is also applied to circuits 13, 13A, fuse A2, circuit 28/19J, connector (399) and
                circuit 19J/19F to the fuel heater relay (431) coil. The relay is energized through ground circuit 19-G
                to the cab ground stud (2G).
            </para>
            <para>With the relay (431) energized, power flows through its contacts, circuit 19A, connector (399),
                circuit 19A, dash connector (2), circuit 19A, fuel filter connector (401), and circuit 19A to the fuel
                filter heater and thermoswitch (N/L). The ground path is through the filter housing and its mounting
                bracket. When the temperature is 50&#176;F or less, the thermoswitch contacts close and cause the heater
                element to activate.

            <para>
                <emph type="bold">Water-In-Fuel Light</emph>
            </para>
            <para>With the key on, power is also supplied through circuit 19J/19H to the water-in-fuel module (470).
                From the module, power is applied through circuit 19C, fuel filter connector (399), circuit 19C, dash
                connector (2), circuit 19C, fuel filter conn. (401), and circuit 19C to fuel filter water probe (N/L).
            </para>
            <para>The ground path for the water-in-fuel module (470) is not a dedicated circuit. The fuel filter housing
                is grounded through its mounting bracket and whenever water builds up to an unacceptable level in the
                filter, the water completes the circuit between the probe contacts and the housing. This energizes the
                water-in-fuel module.
            </para>
            <para>When the water-in-fuel module becomes energized, power is supplied to circuit 19L and the
                water-in-fuel light (433). This energizes the lamp as power flows through the lamp and circuit 19-GA to
                the cab ground stud (2G).
            </para>
            <para>When the key switch is in the start position, the water-in-fuel module is grounded through circuit
                19P, a blocking diode (1CR), connector (399) and circuit 19N to the key switch (63) ground. This serves
                as a bulb check to assure the bulb is operational.
            </para>
            <para>
                <emph type="bold">Fuel Filter Restriction Light</emph>
            </para>
            <para>With the key switch (63) in the ignition position, power is also applied through circuit 19J/19K to
                the fuel filter light (434). From the light, power is applied through circuit 19B, connector (399),
                circuit 19B, dash connector (2) circuit 19B, fuel filter connector (401), and circuit 19B to the fuel
                filter vacuum switch (N/L). When the fuel filter becomes restricted, the fuel filter vacuum switch
                contacts close, completing a ground path and causing the fuel filter light to come on.
