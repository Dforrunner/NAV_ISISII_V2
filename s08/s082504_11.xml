        <title>CHECK THE CIRCUIT DIAGRAM</title>
        <para>Refer to the circuit diagram for possible clues to the problem. Location and identification of circuit
            components may give some idea of where the problem is located.
        </para>
        <para>The circuit diagrams are designed to make it easy to identify common points in circuits. This can help
            narrow the problem to a specific area. For example, if several circuits fail at the same time, check for a
            common power source or common ground connection. Refer to POWER DISTRIBUTION AND GROUNDS in the ELECTRICAL
            SYSTEM TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE. If part of a circuit fails, check the connections between the part that works
            and the part that doesn't work.
        </para>
        <para>For example, if the low-beam headlights work, but both high-beam lights and the high-beam indicator do not
            work, then the power and ground paths must be good.
        </para>
        <para>Since the dimmer switch is the component that switches the power to the high-beam headlights, it is the
            most likely cause of failure.
