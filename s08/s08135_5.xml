            <title>Standard Engine Protection System</title>
            <para>CELECT engines are equipped with an engine protection system as a standard feature. This system
                monitors important engine parameters and logs diagnostic faults when an over- or under-normal operating
                range condition occurs. The engine protection also derates engine torque and engine speed when certain
                engine fluid parameters pass a limit point.
            </para>
            <para>All CELECT engines monitor the following five inputs:</para>

            <para>If any of the above sensors signals conditions outside limits pre-set by CUMMINS, the oil/water
                warning light will begin to flash and the engine will be gradually derated. If the out-of-specification
                condition returns to acceptable limits, the light will turn off, and the fault may be logged as an
                inactive fault in the ECM.

            <title>OPTIONAL ENGINE SHUTDOWN FEATURE</title>
            <para>This feature is optional and must be selected by the customer. The engine protection shutdown is
                triggered when the engine protection lamp starts flashing for the current engine protection/warning
                derate. Once triggered, the engine will shut down after 30 seconds. During the 30 second warning period,
                the standard torque and speed derates will occur. The engine can be restarted by cycling the key switch.
                After the engine is restarted, it will be limited to the maximum torque and/or speed derate levels of
                the out-of-range parameter if the engine protection fault is still active.

            <para>The diagnostic on/off switch receives a 5V signal (circuit 97AN(5V)) from ECM pin #10. Closing the
                switch applies 5V to the ECM at terminal 21. This tells the ECM that the diagnostic ON/OFF switch has

            <para>The low engine idle speed (rpm) can be adjusted with a two-position momentary, increment/decrement
                switch. This function permits the operator to adjust idle speed up or down in units of 25 rpm by
                toggling the switch. Maximum idle speed is 800 rpm and minimum idle speed is 550 rpm. When the idle has
                been changed and the key turned OFF, the new setting is saved in memory. This feature is owner selected
                and can be turned OFF with a Compulink

            <para>A 5V signal from the ECM is present at the switch (circuit 97AX(5V)). Momentarily placing the switch
                increment position or decrement position applies the 5 volts to the ECM at terminal #14 or terminal #23.
                This causes the engine idle rpm to be increased or decreased in 25 rpm increments.
