        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Back-Up Lights With WTEC or LCT Transmission</title>
            <para>The vehicle back-up lights are a set of lamps that come on when the vehicle transmission is shifted
                into reverse. This allows the driver to see while backing when dark.
            </para>
        </svcsubproc>
        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Headlight System With Tilt Column and Douglas Turn Signal</title>
            <para>A headlight system with a turn signal lever controlled dimmer switch is provided for illumination
                while driving.
            </para>
        </svcsubproc>
        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Headlight System With Stationary Column and International Turn Signal</title>
            <para>The headlight system provides illumination for driving and includes a turn signal operated Lift-To-Dim
                (LTD) switch and relay. The system also includes a turn signal lever operated Flash-To-Pass (FTP) switch
                and relay. This allows the driver to momentarily illuminate the high beam headlights and signal other
                drivers of the intent to pass.
            </para>
        </svcsubproc>
        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Daytime Running Lights</title>
            <para>The Daytime Running light feature allows the vehicle to operate in a "Lights On" condition at all
                times without driver input. This system operates the headlights at partial illumination but still helps
                to increase visibility even in bright sunshine.
            </para>
        </svcsubproc>
        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Stop Light Switch (Air Brakes)</title>
            <para>The stop light switch circuit controls voltage to the body builder connector, and is used by the body
                builder stop light circuits.
            </para>
        </svcsubproc>
        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Panel Lights</title>
            <para>Panel lights are low wattage bulbs that illuminate the instrument panel gauges, the automatic
                transmission shift selector and the cruise control panel light. The lights can be dimmed or brightened
                by the panel light variable dimmer control.
            </para>
        </svcsubproc>
        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Daytime Running Lights With Engine Running Only</title>
            <para>The Daytime Running light feature allows the vehicle to operate in a "Lights On" condition, only when
                the engine is running. This system operates the headlights at partial illumination but still helps to
                increase visibility even in bright sunshine.
            </para>
        </svcsubproc>
        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Back-Up Lights With Fuller Manual Transmission</title>
            <para>The vehicle back-up lights are a set of lamps that come on when the vehicle transmission is shifted
                into reverse. This allows the driver to see while backing when dark.
