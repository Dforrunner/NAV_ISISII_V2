        <title>Refrigerator Wiring With PRO SLEEPER</title>
        <para>With the refrigerator on/off switch in the on position, power flows from battery stud (B2) through
            circuits 14AK, 14AV, fuse F10-B, circuit 14AX, fuse 582-C, circuit 86AV, refrigerator on/off switch, and
            circuit 86AG to the refrigerator power source. The ground path is circuits 86-GR, 11-GBD and 11-GBC to
            ground adapter (454). When the ignition is turned on, power energizes the auxiliary bunk blower relay which
            makes available power to circuits 62BP and 62X going to refrigerator on/off switch. This illuminates the
            panel lamp LED through ground path 62-GX, 86-GK, 11-GAF, 11-GBC, 11-GBD, and 11-GBC to ground adapter (454).
            When the refrigerator on/off switch is turned on, the on indicator LED will illuminate through ground path
            62-GX, 86-GK, 11-GAF, 11-GBC, 11-GBD and 11-GBC to ground adapter (454).
