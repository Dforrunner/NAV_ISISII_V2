        <title>3+1 BATTERY SYSTEM</title>
        <para>With the optional 3+1 system, the copper bus bar is removed from between the (B1) and (B2) battery studs
            and a 7 volt magnetic switch is inserted between the deep cycle battery and the other vehicle batteries.
            Thus the deep cycle battery is used to supply the circuits attached to the (B2) battery stud, and the other
            batteries are reserved for cranking when the engine is to be started.
        </para>
        <para>The circuitry is as follows: the (B2) battery stud receives power from the deep cycle battery through a
            black battery cable, circuit 14AC, a 150A megafuse, circuit 14AB, connector (537), and circuit 14AB with the
            ignition key off. With the ignition key in the on position, battery stud (B2) receives power from both the
            black battery cable from the deep cycle battery, and the magnetic switch and red battery cable from the
            other vehicle batteries.
        </para>
        <para>The (B1) battery stud receives power from the vehicle batteries [less the deep cycle battery if
            applicable], over the red battery cable, a 10 GA fusible link, circuits 2 and 14, connector (N/L) [with
            Cummins N14 only], circuit 14, the 150A megafuse, and circuit 14BM.
