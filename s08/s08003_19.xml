        <title>BACKUP LIGHT FUNCTION</title>
        <para>The backup light function is controlled by the WT ECU using the backup relay located in the VIM to apply
            voltage to rear cab connector (13) when the transmission is in reverse.
        </para>
        <para>With the key switch ON, power from F1 fuse is delivered to the Backup Relay at terminal 87 (N.O.).
            Ignition power from the IGN fuse located in the VIM is applied to the Backup Relay at terminal 85.
        </para>
        <para>When the WT ECM determines the transmission is in REVERSE, the ECU closes a ground switch for the Backup
            Relay (terminal 86), causing the Backup Relay to energize. With the relay energized, power from F1 fuse
            (present at backup relay terminal 87) is delivered from relay terminal 30 to the rear cab connector (13).
        </para>
        <para>To summarize the Backup Light system, whenever the ignition switch is ON, ignition power is supplied to
            the Backup Relay terminal 85, and to Backup Relay terminal 87. With the transmission in reverse, The WT ECU
            closes a ground switch causing the Backup Relay to energize and power is supplied from the Backup relay
            terminal 30 to the rear cab connector (13).
