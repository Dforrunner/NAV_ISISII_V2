        <svcprocinfo>
            <para>The ECM shares control of the Engine Brake system with the vehicle driver and the Antilock Brake
                System (ABS) if the vehicle is so equipped. The driver enables the engine brake with the On/Off switch
                (170).
            </para>
            <para>With the cylinder selection switch (171), the driver can select two-, four-, or six-cylinder braking
                for the N14E engine and can select three- or six-cylinder braking with the M11E engine, according to
                driver preference and driving conditions.
            </para>
            <para>The ECM will not allow operation of the engine drake if it senses any of the following conditions:

            <title>ABS/ECM COMMUNICATION</title>
            <para>If the vehicle is equipped with antilock brakes (ABS), the ECM and the ABS controller communicate
                through the J1922 data link (535) with the ECM. If the ABS system senses wheel lockup may occur, it will
                modulate the tractor brakes. This is communicated to the ECM, which would then turn off the engine
                brake.
            </para>
            <para>The ABS system is discussed in GROUP 04 - BRAKES in the CTS-5000 Master Service Manual.</para>

            <title>ENGINE BRAKE ON/OFF SWITCH (170)</title>
            <para>The engine brake On/Off switch (170), gives the operator control of the engine brake function,
                providing the parameters of the previously mentioned items in
                <hotlnk xrefid="x0823505">Engine Brake System Without HT or MT Electronic Transmission</hotlnk>
                section, above, are within their set ranges.
            </para>
            <para>With the key switch on, and the On/Off switch moved to the on position, a ground path is applied to
                ECM (320), terminal 5 and/or 28 depending on the position of the engine brake selector switch (171).
                From these terminals the path is circuit 24AF and/or 24AE, dash connector (3), circuit 24AF and/or 24AE,
                the engine brake selector switch (171), circuit 24AD, the engine brake On/Off switch (170), circuit
                24-G/97-GA, connector (3), and circuit 97-GA/97-G to the ECM (320) common ground terminal 10.

            <title>ENGINE BRAKE SELECTOR SWITCH (171)</title>
            <para>The engine brake selector switch (171) allows the operator to choose the number of cylinders involved
                in the engine braking process.
            </para>
            <para>The selector switch is a two-pole, three-position switch. With the engine brake On/Off switch (170) in
                the on position, and the selector switch set in position 1, a ground path is applied to ECM connector
                (320) terminal 5. The ground path is as described in Engine Brake On/Off Switch (170) section above.
                This causes the ECM to send a signal to braking cylinders one, two, and three (M11E) or cylinders three
                and four (N14E) to be activated.
            </para>
            <para>When the selector switch is set to the number two position, a ground path is applied to ECM connector
                (320) terminal 28. The ground path is as described in Engine Brake On/Off Switch (170) above. This
                causes the ECM to send a signal to braking cylinders four, five and six (M11E), or cylinders one, two,
                five and six (N14E) to be activated.
            </para>
            <para>When the selector switch is set to the number three position, a ground path is applied to ECM
                connector (320) terminal 5 and 28. The ground path is described in Engine Brake On/Off Switch (170)
                above. This causes the ECM to send a signal to all the braking cylinders to be activated for both the
                M11E or the N14E engine.

            <title>SERVICE BRAKE SWITCH (69)</title>
            <para>The service brake switch (closed with brake pedal released) serves both the cruise control and engine

            <para>When the clutch pedal is
