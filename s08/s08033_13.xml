        <para>Turning the key switch to the ON position causes the speedometer/tachometer unit to perform a brief
            self-test. The steps are as follows:

        <step1>
            <para count="1">Turn ignition key to ON position (engine does not need to be started). Observe the
                speedometer and tachometer pointer movement. The pointers should perform as follows:
