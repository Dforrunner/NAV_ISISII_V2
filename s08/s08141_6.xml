            <para>The customer selectable idle shutdown feature shuts down the engine (does not shut down power to the
                cab) after a customer selected (programmed) length of time between 3 and 100 minutes.

            <para>If these conditions are present, the ECM counts down the "customer selected length of time" until 90
                seconds before the scheduled engine shutdown is to occur. At this time (90 seconds before shutdown), the
                yellow Check Engine Light (CEL) begins to flash rapidly. During this 90 second time frame, depressing
                the clutch or applying the throttle will

            <para>The only system component dedicated to the Idle Shutdown feature is the Idle Timer Switch. The other
                inputs (discussed later in this section) to the ECM are from the Throttle Position Sensor (267), Service
                Brake Switch (277), Clutch Switch (225) and engine speed and temperature information from DDEC sensors.

            <title>Idle Timer Switch (269)</title>
            <para>The Idle Timer Switch (269) is a 2-pole switch that is closed when the park brake is applied. One
                switch pole is connected (97AV) to the ECM through connector (273), location H2. This location has 5V
                present. The other side of the switch is ground through circuit 97-GE. Closing the switch causes the
                voltage state at ECM location H2 to change from 5V to ground, indicating to the ECM that the park brake
                is set.
