            <title>Horn(s)</title>
            <para>Power is applied from the cowl junction feed stud to circuit 14H, fuse F24, and circuit 85/85A to the
                coil of horn relay (4N). When the horn button is depressed, power flows through the horn relay coil,
                circuit 85C, inline connector (222), a blue wire to the horn slip ring (J3), the horn button switch, and
                a circuit ground wire to the steering column ground.
            </para>
            <para>With the horn relay energized, power flows from circuit 85/85B, horn relay (4N), the relay contacts,
                circuit 85D, dash connector (2), and horn harness connector (134). With a single horn, power flows
                through circuit 85E to the high-note horn. The horn is grounded through circuit 85-G, connector (134)
                and circuit 85-G/ 11-GJ to the cranking motor ground stud. With dual horns, power flows through circuit
                85D to a splice. From the splice, power flows through circuit 85E to the high-note horn and circuit 85F
                to the low-note horn.
            </para>
            <para>The low-note horn is grounded through circuit 85-GF to a splice and the high-note horn is grounded
                through circuit 85-GE to the same splice. From the splice, ground is through circuit 85-G, connector
                (134), and circuit 85-G/11-GJ to the cranking motor ground stud.
            </para>

        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Turn Signal Switch</title>
            <para>Power is applied through circuit breaker F3, circuit 55, flasher (4A), and circuit 55A/60, to the turn
                signal switch connector (193). When the turn signal switch is moved to the left turn position, the
                switch contacts close and power is applied to the yellow wire, connector (193), and circuit 56 to a
                splice. From the splice, power is applied through circuit 56A to the body builder front end connector
                (13), and through circuit 56D to the body builder rear connector (194). Power is also supplied from the
                splice to circuit 56C and instrument cluster connector (27) to the left turn signal indicator. The
                ground path for the left turn signal indicator is connector (27), and circuit 28-GB/11-GA to cab ground
                (2G).
            </para>
            <para>When the turn signal switch is moved to the right turn position, the switch contacts close and power
                is applied to the green wire, connector (193), and circuit 57 to a splice. From the splice, power is
                applied through circuit 57A to the body builder front end connector (13), and through circuit 57D to the
                body builder rear connector (194). Power is also supplied from the splice to circuit 57C and instrument
                cluster connector (27) to the right turn signal indicator. The ground path for the right turn signal
                indicator is connector (27), and circuit 28-GB/11-GA to cab ground (2G).
            </para>
            <para>The ground path for the flasher (4A) is flasher GND circuit 11-GF and 11-GA to cab ground.</para>
