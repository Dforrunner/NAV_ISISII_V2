        <para>When the work light switch is moved to the position, power flows from the B2 battery stud through circuit
            14T, fuse F2-A, circuit 65A, work light switch (441), and circuit 65B to the left work light, and 65F to the
            right work light. The ground path for the left work light is circuit 65-GF, 11-GAF, 11-GBC, 11-GBD and
            11-GBE to ground adapter (454). The ground path for the right work light is circuit 65-GB, 65-GF, 11-GAF,
            11-GBC, 11-GBD, and 11-GBE to ground adapter (454). With the work light switch in the position, power also
            flows from fuse F4-A through circuits 13V, 28A, work light indicator light, circuit 65C, work light switch,
            and circuit 65-GC, 11-GBD, and 11-GBE to the ground adapter (454), thus indicating that the work light
            switch is turned ON.
