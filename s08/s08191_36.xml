        <para>Refer to ACCESSORY POWER in POWER DISTRIBUTION AND GROUND SYSTEM for a description of accessory power
            circuits to A3 accessory adapter (501). Refer to MIRROR LIGHTS AND HEATED MIRRORS circuit diagrams in
            CTS-5119W or CTS-5273W, for the following discussion.

        <para>
            <emph type="bold">Heated Mirror -</emph>The heated mirror switch (438) receives power from A3 accessory
            adapter (501) through 10A fuse F5-A with the key in the on or accessory position. With the switch on, power
            is applied to the heater element in the mirrors. Note that the mirror switch includes two LEDs.
        </para>
        <para>
            <emph type="bold">Mirror Lights -</emph>Power to the mirror lights is controlled by the cab and trailer
            light switch (466). Refer to LIGHT SYSTEMS for that system. Power from cab and trailer light switch (466) is
            applied to 15A fuse F8-C, which supplies power to operate the mirror lights. The LED that receives power
            from terminal 6 with the mirror switch on is illuminated to indicate that the mirror heaters are on. The LED
            between terminals 7 and 8 is used to illuminate the switch.
