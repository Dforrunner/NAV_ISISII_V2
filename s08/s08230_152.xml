        <title>Throttle Position Sensor</title>
        <para>The pedal mounted Throttle Position Sensor (TPS) is used to provide a throttle signal to the ECM. Sensor
            output is a constant frequency signal with a pulse width that varies with throttle position. This output
            signal is referred to as either "Duty Cycle" or a "Pulse Width Modulated" (PWM) signal and is expressed as a
            percentage between 0 and 100%.
        </para>
        <para>The pedal mounted throttle position sensor is attached directly to the throttle pedal assembly and
            requires no adjustment. This sensor can be replaced separately from the throttle pedal assembly, however, an
            incorrectly calibrated pedal mounted throttle position sensor assembly cannot be calibrated - the pedal
            assembly must be replaced.
        </para>
        <para>Refer to circuit diagram CATERPILLAR C-10 or C-12, - CRUISE CONTROL in CTS-5122W.</para>
        <para>The TPS connects to the cab harness at three-pin connector (309). When the ECM is powered (key switch on),
            the TPS
            <emph type="bold">receives operating voltage (8 volts)</emph>
            at terminal A on circuit 99A which is connected to ECM connector (1014) terminal 4. TPS terminal B is
            grounded by circuit 99-G, 97-GA, 97-G through ECM connector (1014) terminal 5.
        </para>
        <para>TPS terminal C outputs the variable throttle position signal on circuit 99 to ECM connector (1014)
            terminal 66.
        </para>
        <para>The pedal mounted TPS should produce a Duty Cycle of 10 to 22 percent at low idle and 75 to 90 percent at
            full throttle. An electronic service tool can be used to monitor the signal. The percent duty cycle is
            translated in the ECM into a throttle position percentage of 3 to 100%.
