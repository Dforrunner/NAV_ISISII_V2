        <title>Heater-Bunk With 48 and 60 Inch Box Sleeper</title>
        <para>When key switch (40) is moved to the ignition position, power is applied to I2 ignition adapter (495),
            circuit 13AT, circuit 13AU and the coil of auxiliary blower relay (147). The ground path for the auxiliary
            blower relay is circuits 13-GU and 11-GBE to ground adapter (454). This energizes the auxiliary bunk blower
            relay.
        </para>
        <para>When the bunk blower switch is moved to the low speed position, power flows from (B2) battery stud,
            through circuit 14AU, fuse F10-A, through circuit 75W, relay (147) contacts, circuits 75X, 80E, sleeper fuse
            block K (668), circuit 75H, bunk blower switch, circuit 75AD, the full resistor network and thermofuse
            assembly and circuit 75AE to sleeper blower motor. The ground circuit for the blower motor is circuit 11D to
            sleeper ground.
        </para>
        <para>When the bunk blower switch is moved to the medium position, power flows through circuit 75AC, then
            through half of the sleeper blower resistor network and the thermofuse and blower circuits previously
            described.
        </para>
        <para>When the bunk blower switch is moved to the high position, power flows through circuit 75AF, then through
            the thermofuse and blower circuits previously described.
