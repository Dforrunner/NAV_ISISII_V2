            <para>When the tractor brakes are applied, the vehicle stop light switch (421) supplies power through
                circuit 70B to energize the trailer stop light relay (464-R10). With the stop light relay energized,
                power from the (B1) battery stud, circuits 14BH and 14F, 30A fuse F-7D and circuit 70E is sent through
                the N.O. contacts of relay (464-R10) on circuit 70C to the trailer socket harness connector (114)/(575).
                From connector (114)/(575) the stop light power flows through circuit 70C to the trailer socket
                connector (577).
            </para>
            <para>With the left turn signal selected or the hazard switch on, power flows from the (B1) battery stud
                through circuits 14K and 14J, 20A fuse F2-D, circuit 55, flasher (501), and circuit 55A, to the black
                wire of turn signal switch (36).
            </para>
            <para>Power flows out of the orange wire of switch (36) through circuit 56A to energize the left turn relay
                (464-R11) which is grounded through circuits 56-G, 11-GZ, and 11-GI to the left cab ground (429). With
                the relay energized, power flows from the (B1) battery stud through circuits 14BH and 14L, 15A fuse
                F7-B, circuit 56, relay (464-R11) N.O. contacts and circuit 56D to the trailer socket harness
                (116)/(576). From connector (116)/(576) the left turn signal power flows through circuit 56D to the
                trailer socket connector (577).
            </para>
            <para>With the right turn signal selected or hazard switch on, power flows from the (B1) battery stud
                through circuits 14K and 14J, 20A fuse F2-D, circuit 55, flasher (501) and circuit 55A, to the black
                wire of the turn signal switch (36). Power flows out of the blue wire of the turn signal switch (36)
                through circuit 57A to energize the right turn relay (464-R12) which is grounded through circuits 11-GZ
                and 11-GI to the left cab ground (429). With the relay energized, power flows from the (B1) battery stud
                through circuits 14BH and 14L, 15A fuse F7-C, circuit 57, relay (464-R12) N.O. contacts and circuit 57D
                to the trailer socket harness (116)/(576). From connector (116)/(576) the right signal power flows
                through circuit 57D to the trailer socket connector (577).
            </para>
            <para>Power from (B1) battery stud, circuit 94AH, 30A fuse F10-A (location may vary), and circuit 94AG is
                applied to trailer ABS relay (483). When the key switch (452) is placed in the ignition position,
                ignition relay (462-R1) is energized and power is applied to circuit 13H, circuit 13F, I1 ignition
                adapter (518), and circuit 94AJ to trailer ABS relay (483.) This energizes the relay which is grounded
                through circuit 94-GD to G5 ground adapter (533.) Thus power flows through the N.O. relay contacts,
                circuit 94AF, connector (114)/(575), and circuit 94AF to the trailer socket (577).
            </para>
            <para>Power from the (B2) battery stud, circuits 14W and 14B, 30A fuse F3-C, and circuit 68 is applied to
                trailer tail light relay (464-R9). When trailer lights switch (409) is moved to the on position, power
                from the headlight switch (410) and circuit 58E is supplied through switch (409) to circuit 58P and the
                coil of trailer tail light relay (464-R9). This energizes the relay and provides power to circuits 68E
                and 68A, to the trailer socket harness connector (114)/(575). From connector (114)/(575) tail light
                power flows through circuit 68A to the trailer socket connector (577). The trailer tail light relay
                (464-R9) coil is grounded through circuit 58-G, circuit 70-G, circuit 56-G, and circuits 11-GZ and 11-GI
                to left cab ground (429).
            </para>
            <para>Power from (B2) battery stud circuits 14H and 14E, 20A fuse F3-A, and circuit 58D is applied to
                trailer marker relay (463-R8). When trailer lights switch (409) is moved to the on position, power from
                the headlight switch (410) and circuit 58E is supplied through switch (409) to circuit 58C and the coil
                of trailer marker relay (463-R8). This energizes the relay and provides power to circuit 58A, connector
                (116)/(576), and circuit 58A to the trailer socket connector (577). The trailer marker relay (463-R8)
                coil is grounded through circuit 58-GA, circuit 58-G, circuit 70-G, circuit 56-G, and circuits 11-GZ and
                11-GI to left cab ground (429).
