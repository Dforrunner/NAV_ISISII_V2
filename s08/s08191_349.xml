        <para>When the ignition switch is on, power flows in through circuits 13H and 13AK and out through 13-GT to
            energize heater control relay (463-R5). This supplies power from fuse F1-C on circuit 75A through the relay
            on circuit 75B to switch (11) and on circuit 75D to the med. speed relay (462-R3). Heater control relay #2
            (147) is also energized when the ignition is on. Power flows from fuse F-10 on circuit 75J and 75U to the
            high speed relay 2 (201) and to the heater control relay #2 (147). Power flows from relay (147) to control
            switch (12).
        </para>
        <para>When control switch (11) is moved to the low speed position, power flows on circuit 75C through the whole
            resistor and thermofuse assembly to the high speed relay on circuit 75T. From the de-energized contacts of
            relay (462-R2), power is supplied on circuit 75F to blower motor 1. The ground circuit for motor 1 is
            circuits 75-G and 11-G to right dash panel ground stud.
        </para>
        <para>When control switch (11) is moved to the low speed position, switch (12) is also moved to the low speed
            position. Power flows from switch (12) on circuit 75L, through the resistor and thermofuse assembly, to the
            contacts of high speed relay 2 (201), to blower motor 2 on circuit 75P. The ground circuit for motor 2 is
            circuits 75-GA and 11-GB to right dash panel ground stud.
        </para>
        <para>When control switch (11) is moved to the medium position, power flows from switch (11) on circuit 75N to
            energize medium speed relay (462-R3). Power then flows on circuit 75M through half of resistor assembly (27)
            to blower 1.
        </para>
        <para>When control switch (11) is moved to the medium position, switch (12) is also moved to the medium
            position. Power flows from switch (12) on circuit 75K through half of resistor assembly (28) to blower 2.
        </para>
        <para>When control switch (11) is moved to the high position, power flows on circuit 75H to energize high speed
            relay (462-R2). The ground path for high speed relay 1 is circuit 13-GA. Power flows from fuse F1-A on
            circuit 75 through the relay contacts to circuit 7F to blower motor 1.
        </para>
        <para>When control switch (11) is moved to the high position, switch (12) is also moved to the high position.
            Power flows on circuit 75E to energize high speed relay 2 (201). The ground path for high speed relay 2 is
            circuit 75-GE. Power flows from fuse F10-A on circuits 75V and 75U through the relay contacts to circuit 75P
            to blower motor 2.
