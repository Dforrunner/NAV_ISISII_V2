            </para>
            <para>If any of the speedometer, odometer, or tachometer gauge displays is indicating a failure, the
                circuits serving the instrument in question must be checked for clean, tight, unbroken and non-shorted
                connections.

                        removing the cluster. The Pro-Link 9000 with the Instrument Panel Cartridge Kit, or the EZ-Tech
                        with the instrument cluster software can be used to exercise the speedometer/tachometer, through
                        the J1708 data link . Refer to the Pro-Link or EZ-Tech instrument cluster software manual for
                        instructions.

            <para>The cluster will test itself each time the vehicle is powered up and indicates by pointer movement, if
                the cluster is performing properly The pointers should perform as follows:
            </para>
            <seqlist>
                <item>
                    <para>The unit will drive both the speedometer and tachometer needles to the 9 o'clock position for
                        about two seconds and return to the "0" position.

                <item>
                    <para>Both pointers will then advance through one complete smooth sweep and proceed back to the "0"
                        position. This indicates that all output circuits are good and tells the driver that the gauges
                        are good.

                    <para>The speedometer and tachometer pointers do not move on power up.</para>

                    <para>The speedometer and tachometer pointers do not provide a proper gauge sweep or exhibit erratic

                </item>
            </seqlist>
            <para>If either of the above failures occurs, the speedo/tach cluster must be removed from the instrument
                panel and all connections to the vehicle wire harness disconnected for further testing. Refer to
