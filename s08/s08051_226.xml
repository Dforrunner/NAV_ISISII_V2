        <para>The Bunk Fluorescent Light is a fluorescent light assembly designed to provide the main source of
            illumination in the sleeper. Two additional switches, one in each bunk, are located where they are
            accessible. A Reading Light is located in each of the two sleeper bunks to provide illumination for reading
            when the fluorescent lamp is turned OFF, or when additional light is needed.
