        <title>Panel Lights</title>
        <para>When the headlight switch (35) is in the park lights or headlights on position, power is fed to circuit
            62, panel light dimmer control (33), circuit 62-GJ, and 11-GA/11-GF to cab ground. The dimmer control
            (33)/potentiometer provides a variable voltage of 0 to 12 volts to circuit 62A and the panel light feed
            block.
        </para>
        <para>From the panel light feed block, power is fed to circuit 62L, and connector (26) to the left cluster
            lights. The ground path is through connector (26), circuit 62-GE and 11-G to cab ground.
        </para>
        <para>From the panel light feed block, power is also fed to circuit 62E and connector (30) to the switch cluster
            lights. The ground path is through connector (30), circuit 62-GC, and 11-GA/11-GF to cab ground.
        </para>
        <para>From the panel light feed block, power is also fed to circuit 62C and connector (27) to the center cluster
            lights. The ground path is through connector (27), circuit 62-GF, and 11-GA/11-GF to cab ground.
        </para>
        <para>From the panel light feed block, power is also fed to circuit 62B and connector (38) to the heater-A/C
            control light. The ground path is through connector (38), circuit 62-GA, and 11-GA/11-GF to cab ground.
        </para>
        <para>From the panel light feed block, power is also fed to circuit 62M and connector (161) to the heater panel
            light. The ground path is through connector (161), circuit 62-GK, and 11-GA/11-GF to cab ground.
        </para>
        <para>From the panel light feed block, power is also fed to circuit 62J, 62K (62J only with International
            engines), connector (204), and circuit 92A to the Allison transmission VIM connector (377). This provides a
            feed for a shifter control light. The Allison VIM and ECU are both grounded back to the engine starter
            ground stud.
        </para>
        <para>From the panel light feed block, power is also fed to circuit 62D and connector (28) to the right cluster
            lights. The ground path is through connector (28), circuit 62-GH, and 11-GA/11GF to cab ground.
        </para>
        <para>From the panel light feed block, power is also fed to circuit 62H and connector (22) to the switch cluster
            lights. The ground path is through connector (28), circuit 62-GD, and 11-G to cab ground.
