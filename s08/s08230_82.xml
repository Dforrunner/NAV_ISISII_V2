        <para>The CELECT system has a built-in diagnostic capability which alerts the driver of a system problem while
            the engine is running.
        </para>
        <para>The "yellow" Engine Warning Light (not to be confused with the red Oil/Water Warning Light) will turn on
            to warn the driver of an active component or system fault. While it indicates a failure has happened, the
            vehicle can be operated safely. The vehicle should be serviced to solve the problem,
            <emph type="bold">and the situation is not considered an emergency.</emph>
        </para>
        <para>A lighted "red" Stop Engine Light indicates a major CELECT system problem and the vehicle
            <emph type="bold">should be stopped and engine shut down as soon as is safely possible.</emph>
        </para>
        <para>With the key on and engine off and with the Diagnostic switch off, the indicator lights will come on for
            two seconds and turn off as a system test.
