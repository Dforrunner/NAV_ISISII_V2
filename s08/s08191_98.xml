        <title>CRUISE CONTROL</title>
        <para>The cruise control switches are used as idle controls when the vehicle road speed is not present (this is
            a customer selected parameter). Refer to the Operators Manual furnished with the vehicle for cruise control
            operating instructions. Refer to circuit diagram CATERPILLAR C-10, C-12 or 3406E - CRUISE CONTROL in
            CTS-5119W or CTS-5273W.
        </para>
        <para>The cruise on/off switch is lighted to allow for easy location in the dark. Cruise on/off switch circuit
            97AE is an input to the ECM at connector (400) terminal 20. The ground side of the on/off switch is
            connected through circuits 97-GC, 97-GB, 97-GA and 97-G to connector (400) terminal 5. With the switch on,
            the ECM sees 0 volts at connector (400) terminal 20. With the switch off, the ECM sees 5 volts at connector
            (400) terminal 20.
        </para>
        <para>The cruise set/resume switch is lighted to allow for easy location in the dark. Set/resume switch terminal
            2 is connected to the ECM through circuits 97-GB, 97-GA and 97-G to the connector (400) terminal 5.
            Set/resume switch Set terminal 3 is an input (circuit 97AB) to the ECM through connector (400) terminal 35,
            Set/resume switch Resume terminal 1 is an input (circuit 97AA) to the ECM through connector (400) terminal
            44.
        </para>
        <para>With the set/resume switch in the set position, the ECM sees 0 volts at connector (400) terminal 35 and 5
            volts at terminal 44.
        </para>
        <para>In resume position, the ECM sees 5 volts at connector (400) terminal 35 and 0 volts at terminal 44.</para>
        <para>In the set/resume neutral position, the ECM sees 5 volts at both connector (400) terminals 35 and 44.
