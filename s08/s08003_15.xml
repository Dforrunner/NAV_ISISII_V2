        <title>PANEL LIGHT SWITCH</title>
        <para>The vehicle panel light dimmer switch sends variable voltage (when the driver sets brightness level)
            through the VIM to the ECU. The ECU reacts to the changes in voltage from the panel light dimmer control in
            the following manner:
        </para>
        <step1>
            <para count="1">When vehicle lights are OFF or the panel light dimmer is turned completely off, no voltage
                is delivered to the ECU. When this occurs, the ECU will cause the shift selector display to be at full
                intensity.
            </para>
        </step1>
        <step1>
            <para count="1">If the vehicle lights are on, and the panel light dimmer is set to display the panel lights
                at less than the brightest intensity, the ECU sees a reduced voltage (compares the voltage to ignition
                voltage from key switch) and displays the shift selector at something less than full lighting intensity.
            </para>
        </step1>
        <step1>
            <para count="1">With the panel light control set to display panel lights at full intensity, the ECU sees
                full ignition voltage and will display the shift selector lights at full intensity.
            </para>
        </step1>
        <para>The ECU uses the two serial communication circuits to communicate with the shift selector, controlling the
            lighting brightness of the shift selector display.
