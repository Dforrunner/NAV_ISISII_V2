                <para>Any hosing, tubing, battery cable, wiring or electrical harness must not rub on a sharp edge.
                    However, due to the high abrasion resistance of synflex tubing, it is permissible for synflex tubing
                    to make contact with the lower edge of the frame rail flange when the tubing is making the
                    transition from the outside to down and under the rail. This does not mean that proper clearance or
                    the need for protective wrap is not needed when synflex line contacts sharp edges or threaded
                    fasteners.

                <para>Any hosing, tubing, battery cable, wiring or electrical harness must not rub or make contact with
                    a hot surface. There should be 5" minimum clearance from the exhaust depending on the situation. The
                    further back from the turbo, the less clearance required.
