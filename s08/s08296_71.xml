            <title>ATA Data Link and Diagnostic / Programming Connector</title>
            <para>The 9-pin ATA data link connector (384) supplies power for an Electronic Service Tool (EST) through
                fuse F28 and circuit A97C. Ground for the EST is through A97-GK to cab ground (1PG).
            </para>
            <para>The EST is able to communicate with the engine control system through a twisted pair of wire circuits.
                The connector serial data transmission lines are through circuit A98E(+) and circuit A98F(-) to the
                instrument cluster (11). Communication with the ECM2 or IDM2 is through circuit K3AB and circuit K3AB(-)
                to the 48-pin dash connector (6000). From the dash connector (6000), the communication circuits are
                K3AA(+) to ECM2 connector (6021) pin 20 and K3AA(-) to pin 21, and circuits are K3AB(+) to IDM2
                connector (6011) pin 2 and K3AB(-) to pin 3.
            </para>
            <para>The communication system also includes an ATA interface connector (374) for use with aftermarket
                requirements. The communication link for the interface is through circuits A98B(+)/A98H(+) and
                A98D(-)/A98G(-).

        <svcsubproc>
            <title>ECM Power and Ground</title>
            <para>Power is supplied by the batteries to circuit 14A, a 40A inlinefuse (1C-A), circuit 14B, engine
                harness to positive battery cable connector (412), circuit 14B/N97AA to connector (6323), circuit N97X
                to connector (6000), circuit V97X to split circuit V97JA to the ECM2 power relay (6005) coil and circuit
                K97HB, fuse (1B- B4), circuit V97HA to contacts. Also, power is supplied through circuit V97LB to the
                IDM2 power relay (6006) coil and circuit V97TC to contacts.
            </para>
            <para>From the ECM2 power relay (6005) coil, power is applied to circuit V97J and pin 5 of the ECM2 (6020).
                Also, from the IDM2 power relay (6005) coil, power is applied to circuit V97LA and pin 8 of the IDM2
                (6011).
            </para>
            <para>When key switch (20) is moved to the ignition position, power is supplied through fuse F12, circuit
                V97CR, the 48-pin dash connector (6000), and circuit V97CR and a splice. From the splice power is
                applied to pin 3 of the ECM2 (6020) on circuit V97UA . This signals the ECM2 that the ignition switch is
                on and causes the ECM2 to internally switch pin 5 to ground. This completes the circuit for the ECM2
                power relay (6005) which energizes the relay. With the relay (6005) energized, power is applied through
                the closed contacts to circuit V97TA and a splice. From the splice power is applied to the ECM2 (6021)
                pins 1 and 2 on circuits K97FL and K97ZA respectively, and to the IDM2 (6011) pin 10 on circuit K97AZ.
            </para>
            <para>Also, when key switch (20) is moved to the ignition position, power is supplied through fuse F12,
                circuit V97CR, the 48-pin dash connector (6000), and circuit V97CR and a splice. From the splice power
                is applied to pin 9 of the IDM2 (6011) on circuit K97M . This signals the IDM2 that the ignition switch
                is on and causes the IDM2 to internally switch pin 9 to ground. This completes the circuit for the IDM2
                power relay (6006) which energizes the relay. With the relay (6006) energized, power is applied through
                the closed contacts to circuit V97TC and a splice. From the splice power is applied to the IDM2 (6011)
                pin 12 on circuit K97Y, and the IDM2 (6011) pin 6 on circuit K97LC, fuse (1B-B3) and circuit V97LC.
            </para>
            <para>Grounds for the ECM2 (6020) pins 6 and 7 are through circuits K97-GW and K97-GV respectively, to a
                splice. From the splice, ground is through circuit 11-G, the engine harness to negative battery cable
                harness connector (665) and circuit 11-G to the negative battery terminal. Also, grounds for the IDM2
                (6011) pin 1 is through circuit K97-GA to a splice. From the splice, ground is through circuit 11-G, the
                engine harness to negative battery cable harness connector (665) and circuit 11-G to the negative
                battery terminal.

        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Accelerator Position Sensor (APS) and Idle Validation Switch (IVS)</title>
            <para>The engine Electronic Control Module (ECM2) determines the position of the accelerator pedal by
                processing the input signals from the Accelerator Position Sensor (APS) and Idle Validation Switch
                (IVS).
            </para>
            <para>The ECM2 sends a regulated 5 volt signal through the ECM2 connector (6021), circuit K99C, dash
                connector (9851), circuit N99C to a splice, and circuit A99C to the APS/IVS (382). The APS then returns
                a variable voltage signal (depending on pedal position) through connector (382), circuit N99B, connector
                (9851), and circuit N99B to the ECM2. The APS is grounded through circuit A99A/A97W, connector (3), and
                circuit A97W/A97WB to the ECM2 signal ground.
            </para>
            <para>The ECM2 learns the lowest and highest pedal positions by reading and storing the minimum and the
                maximum voltage levels from the APS. In this manner the ECM2 "auto-calibrates" the system to allow
                maximum pedal sensitivity.
            </para>
            <para>The ECM2 auto-calibrates as the key is on, but when the key is turned off, these values are lost. When
                the key is turned on again, this process starts over. When the pedal is disconnected (or a new one is
                installed), the pedal does not need to be calibrated, as the calibration happens when the key is turned
                on.
            </para>
            <para>When the key switch (20) is in the on or start position, the Idle Validation Switch (IVS) (382)
                receives 12 volt ignition voltage through circuit breaker F10, and circuit A99E. When the pedal is not
                in the idle position (throttle applied), the IVS sends this 12 volt signal to the ECM over circuit A99D,
                connector (9851), and circuit N99D to the ECM2 (6021).
            </para>
            <para>The ECM2 compares the inputs it receives on circuit A99B and circuit A99D from the APS/IVS to verify
                when the pedal is in the idle position. If the APS signal from circuit A99B indicates throttle is being
                applied, then the ECM2 expects to see 12 volts at IVS circuit A99D. If the APS signal, circuit A99B,
                indicates throttle is not applied, then the ECM2 expects to see 0 volts at the IVS circuit A99D. The
                timing process is critical between the APS and the IVS sensors. For this reason, it is very difficult to
                determine if the APS/IVS assembly is working properly using a volt-ohmmeter.
            </para>

        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Barometric Air Pressure (BAP) Sensor</title>
            <para>The ECM2 (6021) sends a regulated 5 volt signal from ECM2 (6021) through circuit K99C, dash connector
                (9851), circuit K99C to a splice, and circuit K97BL to BAP sensor (6702). The BAP sensor returns a
                variable voltage signal (represents atmospheric pressure) on circuit K97CD, connector (9851) and circuit
                K97CD to the ECM2 (6020). The BAP sensor is grounded by circuit K97Z/K97W, connector (6000), circuit
                K97W/K97WB to the ECM2 (6021) signal ground.
            </para>
        </svcsubproc>
        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Air Temperature Sensor (ATS)</title>
            <para>The IDM2 (6011) sends a regulated 5 volt reference signal through circuit K97B to the Air Temperature
                Sensor (6303). As the temperature changes, the sensor changes resistance and provides the IDM2 (6011)
                with an air temperature signal voltage. The sensor is grounded through circuit K97S to the ECM2 (6021)
                signal ground.

        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Cruise Control/Remote Engine Controls</title>
            <para>When the key switch (20) is moved to the start or ignition position, battery voltage is through the
                ignition switch relay (1711), circuits A13/A13F, fuse F23, is through circuit A97B to the brake/cruise
                interface relay (1133). The brake/cruise interface relay (1133) is grounded through circuits
                A97-GM/A11-GB to cab ground.
            </para>
            <para>Battery power is applied to fusible link circuit through circuits N14A-FL/N14-FL, circuit A14/A14A,
                circuit breaker F12 and circuit A97DK to the brake/cruise interface relay (1133) contacts. Power is
                supplied to the cruise control On/Off switch (391) through the closed relay contacts and circuit A97DJ.
                When the switch is in the On position, power flows through the closed switch contacts and circuit A97CF
                to the MSM (3115). The MSM (3115) received the On position of the cruise control On/Off switch and is
                communicated&#160;to the ECM2.
            </para>
            <para>The cruise control Set/Resume switch (392) to be operational, with the cruise control On/Off switch
                (391) in the On position and power is applied from the switch to the cruise Set/Resume switch (392)
                through circuit A97DH. Momentarily depressing the Set portion of this switch supplies a 12 volt signal
                to the MSM (3115) through circuits A97DH/A97CA and is communicated&#160;to the ECM2. This engages the
                cruise control and causes the ECM2 to maintain the current engine RPM. If the cruise control speed is
                already set, depressing the switch in the Set position causes the engine RPM to decrease until the
                switch is released.
            </para>
            <para>With the cruise control On/Off switch (391) in the On position, depressing the Resume portion of the
                Set/Resume switch (392) supplies a 0 volt ground signal to the MSM (3115) through circuits A97-GE/A97-GL
                to cab ground and is communicated&#160;to the ECM2. If the cruise control speed has not been engaged,
                momentarily depressing the switch causes the ECM2 to resume the last engine RPM setting.
            </para>
            <para>If the cruise control is already engaged, momentarily depressing the resume portion of the switch will
                cause the engine RPM and speed to increase in small incremental amounts until the desired speed is
                reached.
            </para>
            <para>Engine control circuits are also provided for remote, preset and variable speed switches and a remote
                accelerator pedal for completion by the body builder when remote engine controls are required.
            </para>

                Information in CT-471 Body Builder Book.
