        <title>SENSOR INPUT TO PT PACER UNIT</title>
        <para>The PT Pacer Control Unit receives an AC (alternating current) signal from the vehicle speed sensor and
            the engine speed sensor.
        </para>
        <para>Both sensors have two leads and are dual coil sensors. Even though the resistance of the two coils in each
            sensor is different, the leads are interchangeable. The resistance of one coil is between 900-1100 ohms and
            the other coil is between 1200-1450 ohms.
        </para>
        <para>
            <emph type="bold">Vehicle Speed Sensor -</emph>The vehicle speed sensor is located at the rear of the
            transmission. The sensor is a permanent magnetic and as the speedometer gear rotates, the magnetic field is
            broken, creating the AC voltage. One lead connects to the PT Pacer Control Unit harness and the other lead
            connects to the engine harness speedometer circuits.
        </para>
        <para>
            <emph type="bold">Engine Speed Sensor -</emph>
            The engine speed sensor (installed by Cummins) is located in the engine flywheel housing and the sensor
            magnetic field is broken by the flywheel teeth as it rotates. One lead connects to the PT Pacer Control Unit
            harness and the other connects to the engine harness tachometer circuits.
