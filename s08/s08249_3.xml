            <title>Twelve Volt Power Distribution (Battery)</title>
            <para>Power is supplied by the vehicle batteries to the engine Electronic Control Module (ECM) over battery
                cable circuit 14A, a 50A fuse, circuit 14B, battery/engine harness connector (411) and circuit 14B to
                the ECM module power relay. With models 1152SC and 1552SC, power is also supplied to the electronic
                device power stud through the battery cable circuit 14D, a 20A fuse, circuit 14C, connector (411),
                circuit 14J, dash connector (2) and circuit 14J.
            </para>
            <para>Power is also supplied by the vehicle batteries to the cranking motor solenoid battery stud (B) by a
                2/0 wire. From the (B) stud, power is applied to circuit 90-FL/90/ 90B and the hydraulic brake switch,
                circuit 18-FL/18 and the glow plug magnetic switch, and circuit 14-FL/14 to the cowl junction feed stud
                and the fused power distribution center (590).
            </para>
            <para>From the cowl junction feed stud, power is supplied through circuit 14H to the horn circuitry, and
                also to the fuel heater relay circuitry with 1152SC or 1552SC. With 1652SC, power is also applied from
                the cowl junction feed stud through circuit 14K to the ignition relay (R20).
            </para>
            <para>The power distribution center (590) supplies power to the key switch (63) circuitry and the ignition
                relay (4G) on circuit 15, and to the start relay (590B) on circuit 17C. Power is also distributed to the
                cab fuse panel through circuits 14E and 14F.
            </para>
            <para>The alternator supplies power over circuit 2/2-FL to the cranking motor solenoid (B) stud.</para>

        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Twelve Volt Power Distribution (Key Switch)</title>
            <para>Power is fed to the key switch (63) from the cowl power distribution center (590) through fuse F31,
                circuits 15/15A and 15/15B, dash connector (2), circuit 15A/15D and circuit 15B/15D.
            </para>
            <para>When the key switch is in the on or accessory position, power is supplied to circuit 12 going to the
                cab power distribution center and also circuit 1 going to the instrument panel alternator light.
            </para>
            <para>When the key switch is in the on or start position, power is supplied to circuit 13C and the ignition
                relay (4G). The relay is grounded through 13-G/11-GB to the cab ground. This energizes the relay and
                allows power to flow through fuse F31, circuit 15/15C, dash connector (2), circuit 15C, the relay
                contacts, and circuits 13 and 13A to the cab fuse panel.
            </para>
            <para>When the key switch is in the start position, power is also supplied to the crank inhibit relay (4H)
                through circuit 17, the start interrupt connector (195) and circuit 17A.
