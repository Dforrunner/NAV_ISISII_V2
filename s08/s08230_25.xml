        <title>OWNER/OPERATOR CONNECTION JUNCTION BLOCK (08WBD) - REAR CAB JUNCTION BLOCK, ACCESSORY RELAY</title>
        <para>Power is supplied to (J7)/(181) junction block from the (J1) junction block over circuit 14P, circuit 14B,
            fuse F10, and a brown and green wire in parallel (30 amp max.). Power is also supplied to (J7)/(181), when
            the key switch is in the ignition or accessories position, from (J2) accessories feed block through circuits
            12 and 12A, fuse F15, and a blue wire. Circuit 57H is plugged into connector (182-B) and feeds the right
            turn signal power to stud 1 of (J7)/(181). Circuit 56H is plugged into connector (182-A) and feeds the left
            turn signal power to stud 2 of (J7)/(181).
        </para>
        <para>Circuit 68D is plugged into connector (182-C) and feeds the tail light power to stud 3 of (J7)/(181).
            Circuit 71C is plugged into connector (182-D) and feeds back-up light power to stud 4 of (J7)/(181). Circuit
            11-GR runs between the cab ground and stud 7 of (J7)/(181).
        </para>
        <para>When code 08WBE is ordered, an optional accessory relay (179) is installed. This gives key switch control
            of up to 20 amps of power. When key switch (24) is in the ignition or accessories position, power flows
            through circuit 12, (J2) accessory feed block, circuit 12A, fuse F15, a blue wire, (J7)/(181) junction block
            stud 5, and circuit 12E to energize the coil of (179) accessory relay. The relay's ground path is circuit
            11-GS, (J7)/(181) junction block stud 7, and circuit 11-GR to cab ground. With the accessory relay (179)
            energized, power is available to flow from (J7)/(181) junction block stud 8 through circuit 12F, (179) relay
            contacts, and circuit 12H to (J7)/(181) stud 6. This provides up to 20 amps of accessory feed power.
        </para>
        <para>When code 08WBJ is ordered, an optional relay (179) is also utilized but wired up slightly different. With
            this set-up, when the tail lights are turned on, power is fed to stud 3 of the (J7)/(181) junction block.
            From there power flows through circuit 12E to energize the coil of (179) accessory relay. The ground path is
            circuit 11-GS, (J7)/(181) junction block stud 7, and circuit 11-GR to cab ground. With the accessory relay
            (179) energized, power is available to flow from (J7)/(181) junction block stud 8 through circuit 12F, (179)
            relay contacts, and circuit 12H to (J7)/(181) stud 6. The power is then fed over dual conductors (RD and BN)
            to feed any rear accessories such as body marker lights.
