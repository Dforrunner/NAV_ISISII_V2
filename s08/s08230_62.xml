            <para>When the key switch (24) is in the ignition or start position, power is available at circuit 13, fuse
                F2, circuit 21, connector (23), and the ether start switch. If the engine block temperature is below 10&#176;C
                (50&#176;F), the thermo switch (419) contacts will be closed. This will allow power to flow through the
                ether start switch, when it is depressed, through connector (23), circuit 21B, dash connector (2) and
                circuit 21B to the ether bottle control valve connector (500). Power then flows through the control
                valve, connector (500), circuit 21C, inline connector (600/719), circuit 21C and connector (709), to the
                thermo switch (419). When power flows through the ether bottle control valve, a shot of ether is fed
                into the intake manifold of the engine.
