        <para>The idle shutdown timer is a feature which helps improve fuel consumption by limiting idle time. The
            "shutdown time" is a customer specified parameter, and may be from 3 to 60 minutes. Programming the time to
            zero shuts the timer off.

        <para>The timer is activated and the countdown (from the customer selected time) begins when:</para>

        <para>Ninety seconds before the programmed time is reached, the Yellow Oil/Water Warning light will begin to
            flash rapidly. If the driver moves the clutch or service brake pedal during this 90-second time period, the
            timer will be overridden until it is reset. The timer is reset and begins counting over, by moving the
            vehicle a short distance.
        </para>
        <para>A code (Override of Idle Shutdown Timer) will be logged when the driver overrides the timer within the
            90-second time period. If the timer is activated and allowed to shutdown the engine, then a code (Idle
            Shutdown Timed Out) will be set. These codes record an event- they do not indicate a fault in the system.
