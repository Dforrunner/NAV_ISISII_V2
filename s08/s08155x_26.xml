            <para>When the ECM senses that the oil pressure is low or the water temperature is high, the ECM will apply
                a ground at connector (1091)/pin 5. This will allow power to flow from the battery feed of alarm (R1)
                through circuit 28E, connector (26)/pin 5, the oil/water warning light, connector (26)/pin 10, circuit
                97AZ, connector (333), circuit 97AZ, connector (3), and circuit 97AZ to the ECM connector (1091)/pin 5.

            <para>The engine ECM monitors the oil pressure, coolant temperature, and coolant level sensors, and when the
                oil pressure or coolant level drops below a programmed value or the water temperature climbs above a
                programmed value, the ECM will set its connector (534)/pin 27 to a low state (ground). This allows power
                to flow from fuse F1 through circuits 28D and 28E, connector (26)/pin 5, the oil/water warning light,
                connector (26)/pin 10, circuit 97AZ, connector (333), circuit 97AZ, connector (3), and circuit 97AZ to

            <title>Oil/Water: 2000/4000/8000 Series With Cummins L10-STC</title>
            <para>The oil pressure and water temperature sensors monitor the engine operating conditions. When the oil
                pressure becomes too low or the coolant temperature becomes too high, the sensor contacts close,
                applying a ground to the alarm and oil/water warning light, causing them to activate. The alarm receives
                power from fuse F1 over circuit 28D, and the oil/water warning light receives power from circuits 28D
                and 28E, connector (84)/(85), circuit 28F and connector (26)/pin 5. The warning light illuminates when a
                ground path is applied to connector (26)/pin 10 by circuit 29A/35, connector (85)/(84) or circuit 29/35
                coming from the alarm (R1). The alarm (R1) will sound at a slow rate and the oil/water warning light
                activates when a ground is applied by circuit 29B/35, connector (2), and circuit 35 from the oil
                pressure sensor or circuit 29, connector (N/L), and circuit 29/E29A from the water temperature sensor.

            <para>The engine ECM monitors the oil pressure, coolant temperature, and coolant level sensors, and when the
                oil pressure or coolant level drops below a programmed value or the water temperature climbs above a
                programmed value, the ECM will set its connector (379)/pin 54 to a low state (ground). This activates
                the warning alarm (R1) at a slow rate by allowing current to flow from circuit 28D through the alarm
                (R1), through circuit 97AF, connector (22), circuit 97AF, and 97AG to the ECM (379).
            </para>
            <para>Battery voltage from circuit 28D at the alarm is fed to the oil/water warning light connector (26)/pin
                5. When the ECM (379) sets pin 54 to a low state (applies a ground), the oil/water light will illuminate
                and the alarm (R1) will sound at a slow rate as current flows through it, connector (26)/pin 10,
                circuits 29/35 and 97AF, connector (22), circuits 97AF and 97AG.

            <para>The alarm receives power from fuse F24 over circuit 13B, and the oil/water warning light receives
                power from fuse F22, and circuits 28 and 28D at connector (10)/pin 5. The warning light illuminates when
                a ground path is applied to connector (10)/pin 10 by circuits 29/35 and 97AF, connector (15), and
                circuit 97AF from the ECM (379). The alarm will also sound at a slow rate when this ground is applied by
                the ECM in response to low oil pressure, high water temperature, or low coolant level.

            <title>Oil/Water: 3000RE</title>
            <para>The alarm receives power from fuse F24 over circuit 13B, and the oil/water warning light receives
                power from fuse F22, circuits 28 and 28A, and connector (12)/pin 13. The warning light illuminates when
                a ground path is applied to connector (12)/pin 14 by circuits 29/35 and 97AF by the ECM (379)/pin 54.
                The alarm will also sound at a slow rate when a ground path is applied by the ECM in response to low oil
                pressure, high water temperature, or low coolant level.

            <title>Brake Pressure: 2000/4000/8000 Series With Hydraulic Brakes</title>
            <para>When the hydraulic brake system monitor module (49) detects a problem with the brake system, it
                applies a ground to circuits 90S and 90T. The alarm (R1) receives power from fuse F1 over circuit 28D,
                and when circuit 90S is switched to ground, the alarm will sound at a fast rate. The brake pressure
                warning light is supplied power from fuse F6, circuits 28 and 28A, and connector (26)/pin 1. When
                circuit 90T is switched to ground, power will flow through the brake pressure warning light (causing it
                to illuminate), connector (26)/pin 3, and circuit 90T to the brake monitor module (49).

            <title>Brake Pressure: 2000/4000/8000 Series With Air Brakes</title>
            <para>The brake pressure warning light is fed power by fuse F6, circuits 28 and 28A, and connector (26)/pin
                1. When the air pressure drops below 60 psi, the pressure switch will close, and power will flow through
                the warning light, connector (26)/pin 3, circuits 40, 40B, and 40A, connector (2), and circuit 40
                through the low air pressure switch to ground. This will cause the brake pressure warning light to
                illuminate, and the warning alarm (R1) to sound at a fast rate. The alarm receives power from fuse F1
                over circuit 28D.

            <title>Brake Pressure: 3000FE With Hydraulic Brakes</title>
            <para>When the hydraulic brake system monitor module (86) detects a problem with the brake system, it
                applies a ground to circuit 90M which causes the alarm (R1) to sound at a fast rate. The ground from
                circuit 90M at the alarm is also applied by circuit 90N to the brake pressure warning light, connector
                (10)/pin 3, causing it to illuminate. The brake pressure warning light has power supplied to it by fuse
                F22, circuits 28 and 28A, and connector (10)/pin 1. The warning alarm receives power through fuse F24
                and circuit 13B.

                1. When the air pressure drops below 60 psi, the pressure switch will close, and power will flow through
                the warning light, connector (10)/pin 3, circuits 40A and 40, connector (2), and circuit 40 through the
                low air pressure switch (717) to ground. This will cause the brake pressure warning light to illuminate,
                and the warning alarm (R1) to sound at a fast rate. The warning alarm receives power through fuse F24
                and circuit 13B.

            <title>Brake Pressure: 3000RE With Hydraulic Brakes</title>
            <para>When the hydraulic brake system monitor module (86) detects a problem with the brake system, it
                applies a ground to circuit 90M, connector and blocking diode (25), and circuit 90NA to the alarm (211).
                Power will then flow from fuse F24 through circuit 13B and alarm connector (211), causing the alarm to
                sound at a fast rate. When a problem is detected, a ground is also applied by circuit 90M, connector
                (25), circuit 90N, and connector (12)/pin 9 to the brake pressure warning light, causing it to
                illuminate. The brake pressure warning light has power supplied to it by fuse F22, circuits 28 and 28C,
                and connector (12)/pin 8.

                The light receives power through connector (28)/pin 8 and illuminates when a ground is applied through
                connector (28)/pin 6.

            <title>Susp Low Air: 2000/4000/8000 Series With Hydraulic Brakes</title>
            <para>When the key switch is in the ignition or start position, power from fuse F6 is applied to circuits 28
                and 28C, and susp low air warning light connector (28)/pin 8. Thus when the air pressure in the
                suspension system drops below 60 psi, the air pressure switch will close and power will flow through the
                air susp low warning light, connector (28)/pin 7, circuits 40-GC and 40-GB, switch (230), and circuit
                61-GA to ground. This will cause the warning light to illuminate and the low air pressure alarm (117) to
                sound, thus indicating a problem with the air suspension and possibly preventing damage to the
                suspension and driveline components. The alarm receives power from fuse F30 and circuit 40B, and is
                switched to ground through circuit 40-GB as above with the warning light.
