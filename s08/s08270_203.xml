        <para>The bunk fluorescent light is a fluorescent light and switch assembly mounted at the headliner to provide
            the main source of illumination in the sleeper. An additional light switch is located in the control panel
            where it is more accessible. The reading light is also located at the control panel for the sleeper bunk to
            provide illumination for reading when the fluorescent light is off, or when additional light is needed. The
            cigar lighter is located in the control panel to be used for lighting cigars or powering accessories.
