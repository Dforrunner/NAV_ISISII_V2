        <title>Heater-Cab With Pro Sleeper</title>
        <para>Power is supplied to (B2) battery stud, circuits 14H, 14Z, fuse F1-C and circuit 75A to the heater control
            relay (463-R5). When the key switch (40) is moved to the ignition position, power flows in through circuits
            13H and 13AK to the coil of heater control relay (463-R5). The ground path for the heater control relay is
            circuits 13-GT, 77-G, 58-GA and 11-G to right dash panel ground stud. This energizes the heater control
            relay (463-R5) and allows power to flow through the N.O. contacts and circuit 75B to fan control switch
            (11).
        </para>
        <para>When the heater-A/C blower switch (11) is moved to the low position, power flows through the switch,
            circuit 75C, connector (162), circuit 75C, resistor/thermofuse (27), circuit 75T, connector (161), circuit
            75T, high speed relay (462-R2) N.C. contacts, circuit 75F, connector (161) and circuit 75F to blower motor.
            This causes the blower motor to run at low speed. The blower motor ground path is through circuit 75-G,
            connector (161), circuits 75-G and 11-G to the right dash panel ground stud.
        </para>
        <para>When the heater-A/C blower switch (11) is moved to the medium position, power will flow through the switch
            as in the low speed setting and power will also flow through the switch and circuit 75N to the medium speed
            relay (462-R3). This energizes the medium speed relay (462-R3) and allows power to flow through heater
            control relay (463-R5) N.O. contacts, circuit 75D, medium speed relay (462-R3) N.O. contacts, circuit 75M,
            connector (161), circuit 75M, resistor/thermofuse (27), circuit 75T, connector (161), circuit 75T, high
            speed relay (462-R2) N.C. contacts, circuit 75F, connector (161), and circuit 75F to the blower motor. This
            causes the blower motor to run at medium speed. The blower motor ground path is through circuit 75-G,
            connector (161), circuits 75-G and 11-G to right dash panel ground stud. The ground path for the medium
            speed relay (462-R3) is circuit 75-GC, 50-GB and 11-G to right dash panel ground stud.
        </para>
        <para>When the heater-A/C blower switch (11) is moved to the high position, power will flow through the switch
            as in the medium speed setting, and power will flow through the switch and circuit 75H to the high speed
            relay (462-R2). This energizes the high speed relay (462-R2) which is grounded through circuits 75-GB,
            75-GC, 50-GB and 11-G to the right dash panel ground stud.This allows power to flow from (B2) battery stud
            through circuits 14H, 14X, fuse F1-A, circuit 75, high speed relay (462-R2) N.O. contacts, circuit 75F,
            connector (161), and circuit 75F to the blower motor. This causes the blower to run at high speed. The
            blower motor ground path is through circuit 75-G, connector (161), circuits 75-G and 11-G to right dash
            panel ground stud.
        </para>
        <para>When the blower switch (11) is in the low, medium or high position, power is supplied by the switch to
            circuit 77 and the air conditioner switch (904). When switch (904) is moved to the on position, power flows
            through its indicator light and ground circuits 77-GK and 11-GB to left cab ground (429). This causes the
            indicator to illuminate. Power also flows from switch (904) through the blocking diode, circuits 77S and 77K
            to the A/C control relay (144), thus energizing the relay that is grounded through circuits 77-GS, 82-GA,
            12-GF, 11-GQ and 11-GF to left dash panel ground stud.
