                            <para>The main benefit in having an adequately specified charging system is to help prolong
                                battery life. Also, keeping batteries sufficiently charged provides good cranking motor
                                performance and prolongs the motor's life expectancy. A stated goal of the industry is
                                to improve the charging system durability and extend its life while simultaneously
                                increasing or eliminating maintenance intervals.

                                With the constantly increasing economic pressures, the fleet user may also desire to

                                performance and durability while avoiding performance or weight excesses.
