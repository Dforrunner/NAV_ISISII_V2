                            materials, flames or sparks be kept away from the vent openings of the battery. The gas
                            mixture in the battery cells, which escapes through the vents, could ignite and/or cause an
                            explosion. This is particularly true when jumper cables are being used.

                            suspected, examine all fill vents on the battery. If ice can be seen, do not attempt to
                            start with jumper cables as long as the battery remains frozen. Thaw out the battery and
                            recharge.

        <para>Battery cable terminals must be clean and tight. Use hot water and common baking soda for removing
            terminal corrosion and for cleaning the top of the battery. Brighten the contact surface with steel wool,
            apply a light coat of lubricant sealing grease such as Fleetrite &#174; 472141-C1 or equivalent and
            reassemble. Be sure the terminals are clamped tightly and that the battery is clamped securely in place.
        </para>
        <para>When working around the terminals and battery, use extra care to avoid shorting. A good practice is to
            insulate pliers and screwdrivers.
