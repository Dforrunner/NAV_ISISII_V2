        <para>When the ignition switch is ON, power flows in through circuit 12E and out through 12-GE and 11-GBE to
            energize aux bunk relay (147). Thus when the bunk blower switch is moved to the low speed position, power
            flows from B2 battery stud, through circuit 14AU, fuse F10-A, through circuit 75W, relay (147) contacts,
            circuit 75X, 80E, fuse K1, circuit 75H, bunk blower switch, circuit 75AD, the full resistor network and
            thermo fuse assembly, and circuit 75AE to sleeper blower motor. The ground circuit for the blower motor is
            circuit 11M and 11H to sleeper ground.
        </para>
        <para>When the bunk blower switch is moved to the medium position, power flows as described above to the bunk
            blower switch, then through circuit 75AC, then through half of the sleeper blower resistor network and the
            thermo fuse, and blower circuits previously described.
        </para>
        <para>When the bunk blower switch is moved to the high position, power flows as described above to the bunk
            blower switch, then through circuit 75AB, then without going through any of the sleeper blower resistor
            network, it flows through the thermo fuse to the blower circuits previously described.
