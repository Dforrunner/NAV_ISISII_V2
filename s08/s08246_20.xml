        <title>NEUTRAL START SWITCH FUNCTION</title>
        <para>The neutral start function is controlled by the WTEC III ECU using the neutral start relay located at the
            rear of the cab with 2000, 4000, 8000 and on the platform of the 3600, 3800 and 4000FBC. The relay then
            controls the start motor magnetic switch.
        </para>
        <para>When the key is turned to the start position power is applied by the key switch (24) to circuits 13A and
            13B, fuse F17, circuit 97P, connector (438)/(721), circuit 97P, connector (631), circuit 97P and pin 30 of
            the neutral start relay (615).
        </para>
        <para>If the WTEC III ECU determines that the transmission is in neutral, 12V power from the ECU (632) will be
            applied from circuit 123 to the control coil pin 86 of the neutral start relay causing the relay to
            energize. The relay (615) is grounded through pin 85, circuits 143B and 143E, connector (418), circuit 143E,
            connector (13), circuit A343, connector (807), circuits A343 and 11-GA, connector (426), circuit 11-G,
            connector (665-B) and circuit 11-G to the negative battery terminal.
        </para>
        <para>With the neutral start relay energized, power will flow from relay pin 87 through circuit 97AU, connector
            (631), circuit 97AU, connector (631), circuit 97AU, connector (720)/(438), circuit 97AU, connector (2),
            circuit 97AU, and connector (386). Power will also flow through the jumper, circuit 97A, connector (3),
            circuit 97A and pin 26 to the ECM (379). This will cause the ECM (379) to apply a ground to pin 46, circuit
            97H, connector (3), and circuit 97H coming from the control coil of the crank inhibit relay (661). This will
            energize the relay which receives power from key switch on circuit 17. The jumper plug also supplies power
            to circuit 97L, and the contacts of crank inhibit relay (661). Thus with the crank inhibit relay (661)
            energized, power will flow through the normally open contacts of the energized crank inhibit relay (661) and
            through circuit 17F, connector (2), and circuit 17F to the start relay (387). Thus causing the engine to
            crank over.
        </para>
        <para>To summarize the neutral start system: With the transmission in neutral and the key switch moved to the
            start position, voltage from the ECU energizes the neutral start relay, which closes, delivering voltage
            from the "S" terminal of the key switch through the neutral start relay and crank inhibit relay to energize
            the starter magnetic switch.
