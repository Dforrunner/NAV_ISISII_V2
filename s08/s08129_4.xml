            </randlist>
            <para>The cruise control only operates with the On/Off switch in the ON position, and if the minimum speed
                setting has been reached. The minimum and maximum range is customer selectable and may vary from vehicle
                to vehicle.
            </para>
            <para>The cruise control can be manually disengaged with the on/off switch or automatically disengaged by
                depressing the clutch or applying the service brakes.

        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Cruise On/Off Switch (195)</title>
            <para>The Cruise On/Off switch receives a signal from the ECM on circuit 97AE and is grounded with circuit
                97-GH to a splice, then 97-GA/97-G to the ECM (terminal 2).
            </para>
        </svcsubproc>
        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Cruise Set/Resume (154)</title>
            <para>The Cruise Set/Resume switch receives a signal from the ECM on circuit 97AB (set position) and circuit
                97AA (resume). Circuit 97-GD to a splice, then 97-GA/97-G is the ground path to the ECM (terminal 2).
            </para>
        </svcsubproc>
        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Throttle Position Sensor (158)</title>
            <para>The Throttle Position Sensor receives battery power on circuit 99E (when Run Relay is activated).
                There is a 10 amp fuse, G3, between the Run Relay and the Throttle Position Sensor. The Throttle
                Position Sensor is also connected to the ECM (terminal 40) on circuit 99. The throttle position sensor
                is grounded on circuit 99-G to the harness splice, then circuit 97-GA/97-G to the ECM (terminal 2).
            </para>
        </svcsubproc>
        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Clutch Switch</title>
            <para>The Clutch Switch is utilized by the cruise control and engine brake system. The clutch switch is
                wired as NO (normally open), but is adjusted to be closed with the clutch pedal released. The clutch
                switch receives a signal (circuit 97AH) from the ECM. The clutch switch ground circuit 97-GE goes to the
                ECM (terminal 2).
            </para>
        </svcsubproc>
        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Service Brake Switch (141)</title>
            <para>The Brake Switch (used for cruise control and engine brake) receives a signal from the ECM (circuit
                97AL). The brake switch ground circuit 97-GB goes to the harness splice and on circuit 97-G to the ECM
                (terminal 2).
            </para>
        </svcsubproc>
        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Vehicle Speed Sensor</title>
            <para>The Vehicle Speed Sensor is a dual coil, two lead sensor. One lead is for the vehicle speedometer
                system and the other goes to the vehicle speed buffer. The resistance of the two coils is different, but
                the leads are interchangeable. The resistance of one coil should be 900 to 1100 ohms and the other
                should be 1200 to 1450 ohms.
            </para>
        </svcsubproc>
        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Vehicle Speed Buffer (193)</title>
            <para>The Vehicle Speed Buffer is connected to the ECM (circuit 47D). Circuit 97AC delivers 12V battery
                power to the speed buffer. Fuse G3 (10 amp) is located between the speed buffer and the run relay.
                Circuit 11-DF is the ground circuit for the speed buffer. The ground point is at the engine cylinder
                head ground bolt.
            </para>
        </svcsubproc>
        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Progressive Shift</title>
            <para>If equipped with cruise control, the Caterpillar 3176 engine may be electronically programmed to
                govern the shifting of the vehicle. The maximum RPM of the engine may be limited until certain vehicle
                speeds are reached.
