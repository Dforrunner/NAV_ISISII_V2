            <title>Turn Signal Indicators - Left Turn Signal</title>
            <para>When the left turn signal is selected, power is applied from fuse F3 through flasher 4A to pin A of
                connector (193). The circuit continues on circuits 56 and 56C through pin 6 of connector (27). This
                causes the left turn indicator, which is grounded through pin 2 of connector (27) and circuit 28-GB, to
                illuminate when the flasher makes the turn signal blink.

            <title>Turn Signal Indicators - Right Turn Signal</title>
            <para>When the right turn signal is selected, power is applied from fuse F3 through flasher 4A to pin A of
                connector (193). The circuit continues on circuits 57 and 57C through pin 12 of connector (27). This
                causes the right turn indicator, which is grounded through pin 2 of connector (27) and circuit 28-GB, to
                illuminate as the flasher makes the turn signal blink.

            <title>Water-In-Fuel</title>
            <para>The battery voltage is through the ignition relay (4G), circuit 13A, fuse F16, circuits 13E, 19K, to
                the water-in-fuel module (470), pin A. When the fuel filter (6708) has water in it, the water probe
                provides a ground at pin A of connector (2) on circuit 19C to pin D of the water-in-fuel module. The
                water-in-fuel module supplies 12 volts on circuit 19L through pin 11 of connector (28) to illuminate the
                "WATER-IN-FUEL" indicator. (Includes blub check at power-up.)

            <title>Wait-to-Start</title>
            <para>The battery voltage is through the ignition relay (4G), circuit 13A, fuse F13, circuit 28, the green
                instrument cluster (27), pin 10 to the "WAIT-TO-START" indicator. The "WAIT-TO-START" indicator is
                controlled by the ECM2 (6020). The control from ECM2 connector (6020), pins 12 and 13, is transferred
                over the data link on circuits 5V(+) and 5W(-) through pins 18 and 19 of connector (3), to the MSM
                connector (3040) pins 5 and 6. A ground is sent from the MSM connector (3040) through pin 10, circuit
                18-G, to pin 5 of connector (28). This causes the indicator to illuminate.

        <svcsubproc>
            <title>ABS</title>
            <para>When the Anti-Lock Brake HCU module (279) detects a problem with the brake system, it provides a
                ground on circuit 94E to pin 16 of connector (27). The battery voltage is through the key switch (63),
                circuit 13J, fuse 22, circuit 94D, energizing the ABS warning light relay (4F), circuit 94H, connector
                (3), circuit 94H, connector (261), circuit 94H, with a ground at the HCU module connector (279). The ABS
                warning light will illuminate through the open contacts of relay (4F), circuit 94-GB, to cab ground.

            <title>Headlight Hi-Beam</title>
            <para>When the headlight switch (60) is in the on position, power is supplied to the dimmer relay (4J) on
                pins 1 and 3. When the high beam switch (15) is activated, the ground on circuits 11-GA and 51-G through
                pin A of connector (192) to the switch is removed as the switch is opened. This removes the ground on
                circuit 51D to contact 2 of dimmer relay (4J), causing the relay to de-energize. This applies 12 volts
                to contact 4 of the relay on circuits 52C and 52A, through pin 4 of connector (27), to illuminate the
                high beam indicator on the instrument panel.

            <title>Coolant Level</title>
            <para>The battery voltage is through the green instrument cluster (27), pin 17 to the "COOLANT LEVEL"
                indicator. The "COOLANT LEVEL" indicator is controlled by the ECM2 (6020). When the coolant level is low
                in the coolant surge tank, the MAG switch (400) closes its contacts, a ground, circuit 34-G, through
                circuit 34B, to ECM2 connector (6020), pin 4. This causes the indicator to illuminate.

                instrument cluster (27), pin 10 to the "CHANGE OIL" indicator. The "CHANGE OIL" indicator is controlled
                by the ECM2 (6020). The control from ECM2 connector (6020), pins 12 and 13, is transferred over the data
                link on circuits 5V(+) and 5W(-) through pins 18 and 19 of connector (3), to the MSM connector (3040)
                pins 5 and 6. A ground is sent from the MSM connector (3041) through pin 2, circuit 97AA, to pin 7 of
                connector (28). This causes the indicator to illuminate.

                    <para>The Change Oil/Service interval light default setting is off. The customer can use the service
                        tool to activate the light and enter their own parameters into the ECM2 memory. The STI button
                        (diagnostics flash button) is used to reset the service interval reminder light.

                instrument cluster (27), pin 10 to the "AIR FILTER" indicator. The "AIR FILTER" indicator is controlled
                by the filter minder switch (3110), on the air filter, pin A and B, circuit 95-G, to cab ground. A
                ground is sent through pin 16 of connector (3), circuit 95, to pin 14 of connector (27). This causes the
                indicator to illuminate.

                split, circuits 102 and 104, to the Allison TCM connector (3031), pins 2 and 4 (respective). The "CHECK
                TRANS" indicator is controlled by the Allison TCM. A ground is sent from the Allison TCM connector
                (3031), pin 23, circuit 123, through pin 17 of connector (3), circuit 123, to pin 5 of connector (27).

                the ECM2 (6020). The control from ECM2 connector (6020), pins 12 and 13, is transferred over the data
                link on circuits 5V(+) and 5W(-) through pins 18 and 19 of connector (3), to the MSM connector (3040)
                pins 5 and 6. A ground is sent from the MSM connector (3040) through pin 1, circuit 97AF, to pin 14 of
                connector (28). This causes the indicator to illuminate.

            <para>A ground from circuits 11-GB and 61-G through pin A of connector (475) is present at the air pressure
                sensor. When the suspension air pressure is low, the air pressure sensor will close applying ground
                through pin C of connector (475) on circuits 40 and 40A to pin 13 of connector (28). This causes the
                suspension low air indicator to illuminate and the alarm, which receives power and the ground through
