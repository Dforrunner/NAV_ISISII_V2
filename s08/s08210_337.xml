        <para>When the bunk dome light switch is moved at either of the two locations or the sleeper dome light switch
            is moved, current will flow from battery stud (B2), through circuits 14AK, 14AP, 20A fuse F8 - D, circuits
            63AA, and 63AP to the bunk fluorescent light. The ground circuit is 63-GJ or 63-GK between the two bunk dome
            light switches, and circuit 63-GE or 63-GF going to the sleeper dome light switch, and circuits 63-GA,
            62-GE, 11-GAB, and 11-GB to ground stud at right dash panel. When the ignition is turned on, power energizes
            the panel light feed adapter (503) makes available power to circuits 62M, 62AP and 62E going to sleeper dome
            light on/off switch. This illuminates the panel lamp LED through ground path 62-GE, 11-GAB and 11-GB to
            ground stud (right dash panel). When the ignition is turned on, power energizes the panel light feed adapter
            (503) makes available power to circuit 62BP and 62Z going to bunk dome light on/off switch. This illuminates
            the panel lamp LED through ground path 62-GZ, 11-GAE, 11-GN,11-GAF, 11-GBC and 11-GBD to ground adapter
            (454).
        </para>
        <para>When the lower bunk reading light switch is turned on, current will flow from battery stud (B2), through
            circuit 14AK, 14AP, fuse F8 - D, circuits 63AA, and 63AP, 63AS and 63W to the reading light switch and lamp.
            The ground circuit is 63-GW, 11-GAD and 11-GBD to ground adapter (454).
        </para>
        <para>When the upper bunk reading light switch is turned on, current will flow from battery stud (B2), through
            circuits 14AK, 14AP, fuse F8-D, circuits 63AA, 63AP, 63AS and 63U to the reading light switch and lamp. The
            ground circuit is 63-GU, (switch [220] and circuit 63GX with the Sky-Rise) 11-GAD and 11-GBD to ground
            adapter (454).
        </para>
        <para>In the Sky-Rise model switch (220) is opened when the upper bunk is raised. This will inhibit the upper
            bunk reading light from illuminating.
        </para>
        <para>When the under cabinet light switch is turned on, current will flow from battery stud (B2) through
            circuits 14AK, 14AP, fuse F8 - D, circuit 63AA, 63AP, 63AS and 63AR to the under cabinet light switch and
            lamp. The ground circuit is 63-GR, 11-GAD and 11-GBD to ground adapter (454).
