            <title>Horton Fan With Cummins M11 Or N14 With Or Without Air Conditioning</title>
            <para>The Cummins ECM controls the cooling fan clutch by supplying 12 volts and up to 2 amps of current at
                engine connector (309) pin C. This power is transferred through the Cummins engine harness and circuit
                23D to ECM connector (239) and the red wire of the fan solenoid, causing it to energize. With the
                solenoid energized, the air supply to the fan clutch will come on, and thus the fan stops. The fan
                solenoid is grounded through the black wire and ECM connector (239) of the solenoid, and circuits 23-GA
                and 11-GU to start motor ground (J8).
            </para>
            <para>The ECM cycles the fan to regulate engine temperature and A/C compressor head refrigerant pressure.
                The ECM uses temperature sensors on the engine and input from the A/C pressure switch (240) to determine
                these on/off cycles. This input is the application of a ground signal which originates from the common
                pin 10 of ECM connector (263) and is applied to circuits 97-G and 23-GB, A/C switch or jumper at
                connector (240), circuit 23C and Cummins engine connector (309) pin C. The A/C pressure switch is a N.C.
                switch that opens up at pressures greater the 300 psi, and thus signals the ECM, by removing the ground
                signal, to turn on the engine fan.
