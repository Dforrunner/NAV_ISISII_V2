            <title>ECM Power and Ground</title>
            <para>Power is supplied from the batteries to circuit 14A, a 40 amp in-line fuse, circuit 14B, positive
                battery connector (412), circuit 14B, battery harness connector (426), and circuit 14B to the Electronic
                Control Module (ECM) power relay (396) contacts.
            </para>
            <para>Power is also supplied from the (J1) battery feed stud to circuit 14AA, 14E, fuse F9, circuit 97CT,
                the bulkhead connector (3), and circuit 97CT to the ECM power relay coil. From the relay, power is
                applied to circuit 97AH and pin 25 of the ECM (379).
            </para>
            <para>When key switch (63) is moved to the ignition position, energizes IGN relay # 2 (R3) and power is also
                supplied from bus cab feed (J1), circuits 14AA, 14E, fuse F10, circuit 14F, relay (R3), circuit 13, fuse
                F17, circuit 97CR, the bulkhead connector (3), and circuit 97CR to pin 24 of the ECM (379). This signals
                the ECM that the ignition switch is ON and causes the ECM to internally switch pin 25 to ground. This
                completes the circuit for the ECM power relay (396) and energizes the relay. With the relay energized,
                power is applied through the relay contacts to circuit 97CM and a splice. From the splice power is
                applied to the ECM pins 21, 22, and 41 on circuits 97CL, 97CK, and 97AL respectively.
            </para>
            <para>Grounds for the ECM pins 1, 2, 23, and 42 are through circuits 11-GW, 11-GX, 11-GY and 11-GZ
                respectively, to a splice. From the splice, ground is through circuit 11-G, the battery harness
                connector (426), circuit 11-G, negative battery connector (665) and circuit 11-G to the negative battery
                terminal.

        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Accelerator Position Sensor (APS) and Idle Validation Switch (IVS)</title>
            <para>The engine Electronic Control Module (ECM) determines the position of the accelerator pedal by
                processing the input signals from the Accelerator Position Sensor (APS) and Idle Validation Switch
                (IVS).
            </para>
            <para>The ECM sends a regulated 5 volt signal through the black ECM connector (379), circuit 97U(5V),
                bulkhead connector (3), circuit 97U(5V) to a splice, and circuit 99C(5V) to the APS/IVS (382). The APS
                then returns a variable voltage signal (depending on pedal position) from connector (382), circuit 99B,
                connector (3), and circuit 99B to ECM connector (379). The APS is grounded through circuit 99A, splice,
                97W, connector (3), and circuit 97W, splice, 97WB to ECM (379).
            </para>
            <para>The ECM learns the lowest and highest pedal positions by reading and storing the minimum and the
                maximum voltage levels from the APS. In this manner the ECM "auto-calibrates" the system to allow
                maximum pedal sensitivity. The ECM auto-calibrates as the key is ON, but when the key is turned OFF,
                these values are lost. When the key is turned ON again, this process starts over. When the pedal is
                disconnected (or a new one is installed), the pedal does not need to be calibrated, as the calibration
                happens when the key is turned ON.
            </para>
            <para>The Idle Validation Switch (IVS) (382) receives 12 volt ignition voltage from key switch (63), from
                the energized IGN relay # 2 (R3) power is supplied from bus cab feed (J1), circuits 14AA, 14E, fuse F10,
                circuit 14F, circuit 13, fuse F18, and circuit 99E. When the pedal is not in the idle position (throttle
                applied), the IVS sends this 12 volt signal to the ECM over circuit 99D, connector (3), and circuit 99D
                to the ECM (379).
            </para>
            <para>The ECM (379) compares the inputs it receives on circuit 99B and circuit 99D from the APS/IVS to
                verify when the pedal is in the idle position. If the APS signal from circuit 99B indicates throttle is
                being applied, then the ECM expects to see 12 volts at IVS circuit 99D. If the APS signal, circuit 99B,
                indicates throttle is not applied, then the ECM expects to see 0 volts at the IVS circuit 99D. The
                timing process is critical between the APS and the IVS sensors. For this reason, it is very difficult to
                determine if the APS/IVS assembly is working properly using a volt-ohmmeter.

        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Barometric Air Pressure (BAP) Sensor</title>
            <para>The ECM (379) sends a regulated 5 volt signal from ECM (379) by circuit 97U(5V), bulkhead connector
                (3), circuit 97U(5V) to a splice, and circuit 97BL(5V) to BAP sensor (406). The BAP sensor returns a
                variable voltage signal (represents atmospheric pressure) on circuit 97CD, connector (3) and circuit
                97CD to the ECM (379). The BAP sensor is grounded by circuit 97Z, splice, 97W, connector (3), circuit
                97W, splice, 97WB to the ECM (379) signal ground.
            </para>

        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Air Temperature Sensor (ATS)</title>
            <para>The ECM (379) sends a regulated 5 volt reference signal through circuit 97AX to the Air Temperature
                Sensor (463). As the temperature changes, the sensor changes resistance and provides the ECM with an air
                temperature signal voltage. The sensor is grounded through circuit 97BU/97WB to the ECM signal ground.
            </para>

        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Cruise Control/PTO System</title>
            <para>Power is supplied to the cruise/throttle ON/OFF switch (391) through key switch (63) ignition
                position, energized IGN relay # 2 (R3), and power is supplied from bus cab feed (J1), circuits 14AA,
                14E, fuse F10, circuit 14F, relay (R3) terminals, circuit 13, 13C, fuse F24 and circuit 28/97B to coil
                of brake/cruise interface relay (R6). Ground for relay (R6) is provided in circuits 97-GA, 11-GB to bus
                cab ground. When the ON/OFF switch (391) is in the ON position, power is supplied from bus cab feed
                (J1), circuits 14AA, 14A, fuse F3, circuit 97DK, relay (R6) terminals, circuits 97DJ, 97CF, dash
                connector (2) and circuit 97CF to ECM (379). This enables the cruise control.
            </para>
            <para>With the cruise control ON/OFF switch in the ON position, power is also applied from the switch to the
                cruise/throttle set/coast resume/accel switch (392) through circuit 97CA. Momentarily depressing the
                set/coast portion of this switch supplies a 12 volt signal to the ECM through circuit 97DH, dash
                connector (2), and circuit 97DH. This engages the cruise control and causes the ECM to maintain the
                current engine RPM. If the cruise control speed is already set, depressing the switch in the set/coast
                position causes the engine RPM to decrease until the switch is released.
            </para>
            <para>With the cruise control ON/OFF switch (391) in the ON position, depressing the resume/accel portion of
                the set/coast resume/accel switch (392) supplies a 12 volt signal to the ECM through circuit 97DE, dash
                connector (2) and circuit 97DE. If the cruise control speed has not been engaged, momentarily depressing
                the switch causes the ECM to resume the last engine RPM setting. If the cruise control is already
                engaged, momentarily depressing the resume/accel portion of the switch will cause the engine RPM and
                speed to increase in small incremental amounts until the desired speed is reached.
            </para>
            <para>The cruise control switches and circuitry are also used for in-bus cab control of preset, variable,
                and mobile PTO operation applications and require programming of the engine ECM.
            </para>

                Information in CT-471 Body Builder Book.

            <title>Radiator Shutters and Fans</title>
            <para>When the key switch (63) is turned ON, ignition position energized IGN relay # 1 (R2), and power is
                supplied from bus cab feed (J1), circuits 14AA, 14C, fuse F8, circuit 14D, relay (R2) terminals, circuit
                13B, fuse F15, circuit 13H, dash connector (3), circuit 13H, splice, circuit 97ACD to the ECM (397), and
                circuits 23, 23A, to the fan/shutter/ac connector (337). From connector (337), power is supplied through
                circuits 23, 23A, 23B, shutter solenoid connector (340), and the pigtail to the solenoid. [With
                hydraulic operated shutters, power is supplied from connector (340) to the solenoid through circuit 23B
                utilizing a jumper harness.]
            </para>
            <para>Based on limits and settings programmed into the engine ECM, the ECM determines shutter opening and
                closing requirements. To close the shutters, the ECM applies a ground at pin 9 of the gray ECM connector
                (1205). This completes the ground to the solenoid through the solenoid pigtail (circuit 97ESS with
                hydraulic shutters), connector (340), circuit 97ESS, engine connector (336), and circuit 97ESS to the
                ECM. This energizes the solenoid which causes the shutters to close. When the ECM connector (1205)
                determines additional engine cooling is required, ground is removed from pin 9 which de-energizes the
                solenoid and causes the shutters to open.
            </para>
            <para>The following fan operation is for turning the fan ON and OFF. When the key switch (63) is turned ON,
                ignition position energized IGN relay # 1 (R2), and power is supplied from bus cab feed (J1), circuits
                14AA, 14C, fuse F8, circuit 14D, relay (R2) terminals, circuit 13B, fuse F15, circuit 13H, dash
                connector (3), circuit 13H, splice, circuit 97ACD to the ECM (397), and circuits 23, 23A, to the
                fan/shutter/ac connector (337). From connector (337), power is supplied through circuits 23, 23A, 23C,
                fan clutch relay (339), and circuit 23D, relay (339) terminals, circuit 23E, connector (335) for the fan
                clutch solenoid. Ground path is supplied for the solenoid (335) in circuit 23-G to dash ground.
            </para>
            <para>Based on limits and settings programmed into the engine ECM, the ECM determines fan ON/OFF operation.
                To turn OFF the fan, the ECM applies a ground at pin 8 of the gray ECM connector (1205). This completes
                the ground to the fan clutch relay (339), through circuit 97EFS, engine connector (336), and circuit
                97EFS to the ECM. This energizes the relay (339), opening circuit 23E, de-energizes the fan clutch
                solenoid (335) and turning the fan OFF. When the ECM connector (1205) determines additional engine
                cooling is required, ground is removed from pin 8, de-energizes the fan clutch relay (339), closing
                circuit 23E, energizes the fan clutch solenoid (335) and turning the fan ON.
