        <svcprocinfo>
            <para>The "Brain" of the PEEC III and 3176 engine control system is two components working together: the
                Electronic Control Module (ECM) and the Vehicle Personality Module (VPM). The ECM is mounted on the left
                side of the engine and the VPM is mounted on the ECM. The ECM is the computer which controls the PEEC
                III and 3176 engine. The VPM contains the operating instructions (software) including owner selected
                parameters and other engine information for the ECM to use, controlling how the ECM behaves.
            </para>
            <para>The International vehicle's electrical system connects to the Caterpillar ECM using International
                40-pin OEM connector, (263). OEM connector (263) connects to the
                <emph type="bold">Caterpillar engine harness 40-pin connector J7</emph>. All electronic communication
                between the International electrical system and the Caterpillar engine control system go through the
                (263)/(J7) connection.
            </para>
            <para>The ECM receives operating power (12 volt DC) from the vehicle batteries through International engine
                harness OEM connector (C263) when the ignition key switch is ON (IGN position). The ECM is intended to
                operate on 12V, but will tolerate voltage as low as 6 volts during cranking, or 9 volts during engine
                operation. The ECM is protected against power surges on the 12 volt power supply due to alternator load
                dumps, air conditioner clutches, etc. and for jump starting.
            </para>
            <para>The ECM acts as power supply for many Caterpillar and International components used to monitor and
                control the engine/vehicle systems.

        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Inputs And Outputs</title>
            <para>The ECM is connected to the International installed switches that communicate with the ECM. The
                switches are 2-way or 3-way switches and are either ON or OFF. EXAMPLE OF A 2-WAY SWITCH: The ECM needs
                to know if the Cruise Control switch is either ON or OFF. To accomplish this the switch is connected to
                the ECM with two circuits.
            </para>
            <step1>
                <para count="1">Each International installed switch has an "input" circuit that is connected through OEM
                    connector (263) to an assigned ECM terminal. This circuit has 5 volts applied at the ECM terminal.
                </para>
            </step1>
            <step1>
                <para count="1">Each switch is connected to a "common" or ground circuit that is connected through OEM
                    connector (263) terminal #2 to ECM ground (part of Caterpillar harness).
                </para>
            </step1>
            <step1>
                <para count="1">When the switch is OPEN (cruise off), the ECM will see 5 volts present at the input
                    circuit terminal of the ECM. Turning the cruise switch to the ON position, CLOSING the switch causes
                    the ECM to see 0 volts (ground voltage will be 0 to 0.5 volts). The ECM programming has established
                    that the Cruise Control Switch is OFF when it sees 5 volts from OEM connector (263) terminal 10 at
                    ECM terminal 36, or cruise is ON when the ECM sees 0 volts.
                </para>
            </step1>
            <para>EXAMPLE: The service brake switch (317) is connected by input circuit (97AL) to OEM connector (263)
                terminal #30. Terminal #30 has a 5-volt signal present. With the brake switch closed (pedal released)
                the circuit is complete between terminals #30 (input) and #2 (common or ground). This causes the 5-volt
                signal at terminal #30 to go to zero. This tells the ECM that the service brake switch is closed (pedal
                released).
            </para>
            <para>This type of circuit is used to communicate switch and some sensor information to the ECM. Some
                sensors receive a 5 volt signal and return a variable voltage indicating some variable attribute. The
                ECM also uses 12-volt circuits to enable (activate) relays in the system.
            </para>
            <para>The ECM receives "inputs" through OEM connector (263) from the following International components:

            <title>Key On - Battery Power To ECM</title>
            <para>The ECM receives battery power from OEM connector (263) terminal #1 whenever the Ignition Key Switch
                is in the IGN position.
            </para>
            <para>The battery power to the ECM is switched ON or OFF by the RUN RELAY (280), which is energized by
                turning the key switch to the IGN position.
            </para>
            <step1>
                <para count="1">Turning the key switch to the IGN position energizes the RUN RELAY. Voltage from J2
                    Ignition feed stud (circuit 16-19) through CS1, 20A yellow circuit breaker* is applied (circuit 97A)
                    to the RUN RELAY control coil terminal (85) causing the relay to energize. The RUN RELAY control
                    coil ground path is circuit 11-DB to the RH cowl inner panel (J4).

                    magnetic switch. The battery power is present at terminal 30 at all times, key on or off.
                </para>
                <para>Energizing the RUN RELAY causes battery power from B5 to flow through the relay (common terminal
                    30 to normally open terminal 87) then on circuit 97B to in-line fuse P1. From P1 fuse, circuit 97F
                    delivers battery power through the cab and engine harness to OEM connector (263) terminal #1.

            <para>It is important to note that 12V battery power from RUN RELAY is also distributed to the Throttle

            <title>Power To ECM While Cranking Engine</title>
            <para>When cranking the engine, International circuit 97H delivers battery power through OEM connector C263
                terminal 4 to the ECM. The ECM applies this power to energize the fuel shutoff solenoid (turn fuel
                supply on) during the cranking process. When the starter is released, the ECM supplies hold-in voltage
                keeping the shutoff solenoid energized and no voltage is present from the vehicle on circuit 97H.
            </para>
            <para>Depressing the start button energizes the start magnetic switch causing battery power to flow from the
                start magnetic switch through B6, 25A circuit breaker, and circuit 97H to OEM connector (263) terminal
                #4. When the starter button is released, this voltage is cut off.
            </para>
            <para>There is a manual shutoff lever located on the fuel pump. The shaft has a spring to keep it in the
                neutral position. The shaft can be manually rotated counter-clockwise to shut fuel OFF or clockwise to
