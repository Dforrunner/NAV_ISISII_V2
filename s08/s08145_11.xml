            <para>This manual discusses only the engine brake controls as they relate to International installed
                components, including the Engine Brake ON/OFF switch (66), the Engine Brake Selector switch (198) and
                the Engine Brake Enable Relay (45). The International installed Clutch Switch and Service Brake Switch
                also provide inputs to the Engine Brake Control System and are discussed in paragraphs

                    The engine brake stays engaged (latched ON) until one of the other ECM inputs changes: clutch pedal
                    depressed, throttle pedal depressed, engine speed drops below 950 rpm or the brake pedal is
                    depressed a second time.

                    Enable Relay (45) is controlled by the ABS system Engine Brake Relay. This allows the ABS system to
                    "turn off" the engine brake when the ABS system detects that one or more of the vehicle wheels is
                    encountering a slippery road surface.

            <para>To summarize the engine brake controls, the ECM sends a 12-volt signal (when conditions are correct)
                to energize the engine brake relay (45), and the driver must turn the engine brake ON to ground the
                engine brake relay and to deliver ignition voltage from the relay to the engine brake solenoids. The ABS
                system has the ability to turn the engine brake off if wheel lockup is about to occur.

            <title>Engine Brake Enable Relay (45) And ON/OFF Switch (66)</title>
            <para>To "enable" (turn on) the engine brake control system, the Engine Brake Enable Relay must be
                energized. To energize the relay two things must occur:
            </para>
            <step1>
                <para count="1">The ECM must supply battery voltage through OEM connector C263, terminal 22, to energize
                    the Engine Brake Enable Relay control coil.
                </para>
            </step1>
            <step1>
                <para count="1">The ON/OFF switch must be in the ON position to complete the Engine Brake Enable Relay
                    control coil ground path.
                </para>
            </step1>
            <para>Turning the Engine Brake ON/OFF Switch to the ON position completes the ground path (24Y/24-G) for the
                Engine Brake Enable Relay to the cylinder head ground. When all conditions are correct (paragraphs 2.5.2
                and 2.5.3), the ECM applies 12 volts on circuit 24Z to the Engine Brake Enable Relay energizing coil
                (terminal 85) causing the relay to energize.
            </para>
            <para>Energizing the Engine Brake Enable Relay causes the relay switch to toggle, completing the circuit
                between the relay common terminal (30) and the normally open terminal (87). The Engine Brake Relay
                common terminal (30) has ignition voltage from circuit breaker S18 present whenever the key is ON. With
                the relay energized, the ignition power is delivered (circuit 24B) through the closed contacts of the
                Engine Brake ON/OFF Switch to the Engine Brake Selector Switch (circuit 24C).

            <title>Engine Brake Selector Switch (198)</title>
            <para>The Engine Brake Selector Switch receives power from the Engine Brake ON/OFF switch.</para>
            <para>With the PEEC III 3406C engine, the selector switch directs ignition power through the cab and engine
                harness to either the front (circuit 24E), rear (circuit 24D) or both engine brake solenoids.
            </para>
            <para>With the 3176 engine, the selector switch directs ignition power through the cab and engine harness to
                all three engine solenoids (full brake), or center solenoid only (circuit 24D), or only to the front and
                rear solenoids (circuit 24F and 24H).
            </para>
            <para>International installs the harness to the solenoids, although the engine brake solenoids are installed
                by Caterpillar.

                        diagram. The diode's purpose is to prevent voltage spikes (spikes are created when the engine
                        brake solenoid field collapses) from entering the electrical system causing damage to electronic
                        components.
