        <title>Headlight System With Canadian DRL, With Signal-Stat 910 Turn Signal Switch, Floor-Mounted Dimmer Switch,
            Air Brakes and Without International Engine
        </title>
        <para>Power is supplied to (J1) junction block, circuit 14F, fuse F26, and circuit 50 to the headlight switch
            (35). When the headlight switch (35) is moved to the headlight on position, power flows through circuit 51,
            connector (1DRL), circuit 51F, connector (17), and the green wire to the floor-mounted dimmer switch.
        </para>
        <para>When the dimmer switch is in the low/dim position, power flows through the switch, the blue wire,
            connector (17), circuits 53B, 53, connector (2), and circuit 53 to a splice.
        </para>
        <para>From the splice, power flows through circuit 53B to the left headlight (502) low beam element. The ground
            path is through circuit 66C, connector (2), circuit 66C, DRL day relay (163) N.C. contacts, and circuit
            66-GA to cab ground. This causes the headlight dim element to illuminate.
        </para>
        <specpara>
            <note>
                <para>When headlight switch (35) is in the on position, power flows from the switch through circuit 51,
                    connector (1DRL), circuit 66E, connector (167), (166), 39 ohm resistor, connector (166), (167),
                    circuit 66D, DRL night relay (162) coil, circuit 66-GC, and circuit 66-GA to cab ground. Thus, when
                    the headlight switch (35) is on, DRL night relay (162) is energized, and DRL day relay (163) is
                    de-energized.
                </para>
            </note>
        </specpara>
        <para>From the splice, power also flows through circuit 53A to the right headlight (504) low beam element. The
            ground path is through circuits 11-GE, 11-GB, connector (2), and circuit 11-GB to cab ground. This causes
            the headlight dim element to illuminate.
        </para>
        <para>When the floor-mounted dimmer switch is depressed to switch to high beam position, power flows through the
            dimmer switch, the brown wire, connector (17), circuits 52F, 52, connector (2) and circuit 52 to a splice.
        </para>
        <para>From the splice, power flows through circuit 52C to the left headlight (502) high beam element. The ground
            path is through circuit 66C, connector (2), circuit 66C, DRL day relay (163) N.C. contacts, and circuit
            66-GA to cab ground. This causes the headlight bright element to illuminate.
        </para>
        <para>From the splice, power also flows through circuit 52B to the right headlight (504) high beam element. The
            ground path is through circuits 11-GE, 11-GB, connector (2), and circuit 11-GB to cab ground. This causes
            the headlight bright element to illuminate.
        </para>
        <para>Power is also applied to (J1) junction block, circuit 14L, fuse F31, circuit 66A, and DRL day relay (163)
            N.O. contacts. Thus, when the headlight switch is in the off position and the air parking brakes are
            released, power flows from the key switch (24) accessory terminal through circuit 66, DRL day relay (163)
            coil, circuit 66B, air pressure switch (168) N.O. contacts, circuit 66F, DRL night relay (162) N.C.
            contacts, and circuit 66-G to cab ground.
        </para>
        <para>This energizes DRL day relay (163) and allows power to flow from (J1) junction block through circuit 14L,
            fuse F31, circuit 66A, the N.O. contacts of DRL day relay (163), circuit 66C, connector (2), and circuit 66C
            to the left headlight (502). Power then flows through the low beam element, circuits 53B, 53A, the low beam
            element of the right headlight, circuits 11-GE, 11-GB, connector (2), and 11-GB to cab ground. This causes
            the low beam lamps to be on at about 50% brightness.
