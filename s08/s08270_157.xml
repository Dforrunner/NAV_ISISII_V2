        <title>CRUISE CONTROL</title>
        <para>The cruise control operates when vehicle speed is greater than 20 mph and engine speed is greater than
            1100 rpm. The vehicle speed signal used by the ECM to control the cruise system comes from the Navistar
            installed vehicle speed sensor. The PTO mode is activated when vehicle speed is zero and the park brake is
            set [park brake switch (268) contacts open]. Releasing the park brake disables the PTO controls.
        </para>
        <para>The cruise control and PTO systems share the same components, which include a cruise on/off switch (419),
            cruise set/resume switch (418), service brake switch (5), idle timer/park brake switch (328), clutch pedal
            switch (55), and vehicle speed sensor (225).
        </para>
        <para>The lighted cruise on/off switch (419) is connected by circuit 97AE, connector (262), and circuit 97AE to
            the ECM (341). The other side of switch (419) is connected through circuits 97-GC, 97-GA, connector (262),
            circuits 97-GA and 97-G, connector (N/L), circuits 97-G and 11-G, connector (N/L), and circuit 11-G to
            negative battery stud. With the switch in the on position, the voltage state at the ECM input changes to
            ground, telling the ECM that the switch is in the on position.
        </para>
        <para>The lighted set/resume switch (418) is connected by circuit 97AB, connector (262), and circuit 97AB to the
            ECM (341). The switch is also connected by circuit 97AA, connector (262), and circuit 97AA to the ECM (341).
            The switch (418) is connected by circuits 62-GK and 11-GJ to the L3 panel lights ground adapter (505).
        </para>
        <para>With the switch held in the set position, circuit 97AB is switched to ground, signaling the ECM. With the
            switch held in the resume position, circuit 97AA is switched to ground, signaling the ECM.
