        <title>Horton Fan With Detroit Series 60 With Or Without Air Conditioning</title>
        <para>Power from the ignition adapter (518) is applied to circuit 13R, 10A fuse F10-A (location may vary),
            circuit 23A, connector (102)/(338), circuit 23A, and the fan solenoid connector (227) and its red wire. The
            Detroit Diesel ECM controls the cooling fan clutch by providing or removing a ground path to the fan
            solenoid through the black wire, connector (227) of the fan solenoid, and circuit 23D to the ECM connector
            (341) pin A2. When a ground is applied, the solenoid will energize. With the solenoid energized, the air
            supply to the fan clutch will be cut off and thus the fan will stop.
        </para>
        <para>The ECM cycles the fan to regulate engine temperature and A/C compressor head refrigerant pressure. The
            ECM uses temperature sensors on the engine and input from the A/C pressure switch (236) to determine these
            on/off cycles. This input is the application of a ground signal which originates from the ECM power ground
            and is applied to circuits 97-G and 23-GB, A/C switch or jumper at connector (236), and circuit 23C to the
            ECM connector (341). The A/C pressure switch is a N.C. switch that opens up at pressures greater the 275
            psi, and thus signals the ECM to turn on the engine fan, by removing the ground signal.
