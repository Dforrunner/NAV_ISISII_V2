        <para>All PEEC equipped vehicles have a yellow "Engine Warning" lamp located in the cab. Every time the key is
            turned to the ignition position (engine must be started with Kysor Engine Shutdown), the warning lamp will
            come on for 10 seconds and turn off. If the light remains on, and flashes a code number, it is an indication
            that the PEEC system has detected a problem with the engine. Consult the Caterpillar PEEC manual furnished
            with the vehicle for further information.

        <para>If a problem is detected by the ECM system, use the Electronic Control Analyzer Programmer (ECAP), the
