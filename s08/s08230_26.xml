            <para>When the key switch (24) is in the ignition or accessories position, voltage is available through
                circuit 12, circuit 12A, fuse F16, circuit 86, and connector (39-D) to the AM/FM cassette radio. Power
                is also supplied from (J1) junction block, circuits 14R, 14D, fuse F22, circuit 86E, and connector
                (39-A) to the AM/FM cassette radio to retain station programming. The ground path is through connector
                (94), circuit 86-G, circuit 62-G (omitted with International electronic engines), circuit 11-GA and
                circuit 11-GF to cab ground.
