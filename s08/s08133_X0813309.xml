            <title>Engine Warning Light</title>
            <para>The Engine Warning Light (Caterpillar Check Engine/Diagnostic Light) is located on the instrument
                panel and performs three functions.

                    <para>The Engine Warning Light alerts the driver when the engine control system requires service.
                        The light comes ON and blinks (1/2 second) every five seconds whenever an ACTIVE fault code is
                        present.

                <item>
                    <para>The Engine Warning Light is turned ON as part of a system test each time the vehicle is
                        started. When the key is turned to the IGN position, the Engine Warning Light comes ON for
                        approximately 6 seconds and goes out after the engine is started.
                    </para>
                    <para>If the Engine Warning Light comes ON and stays ON after initial engine start-up, the ECM has
                        detected a problem.

                <item>
                    <para>The Engine Warning Light can be used to flash diagnostic codes so that the codes can be read
                        without using an electronic service tool. Refer to 4.0

            <title>Data Link Connector</title>
            <para>The Data Link 8-pin (a 6-pin connector is optional) connector (68) provides an electrical connection
                allowing communication between the ECM and Caterpillar and MPSI electronic service tools. Data Link
                connector (68) is located on the left kick panel. Four of the eight Data Link connector terminals have
                circuits assigned. Those terminal/circuits are as follows:
            </para>
            <seqlist>
                <item>
                    <para>Terminal #1 is the positive (+) data link connection to the ECM through ECM connector (320)
                        terminal #32.
                    </para>
                </item>
                <item>
                    <para>Terminal #2 is the negative (-) data link connection to the ECM through ECM connector (320)
                        terminal #21. The positive and negative data link circuits are a twisted pair of wires.
                    </para>
                </item>
                <item>
                    <para>Terminal #3 has ignition voltage when the key is ON. The ignition voltage (12V) powers
                        electronic service tools when connected to the Data Link. Data Link connector (320) terminal #3
                        receives power (circuit 97DL) from the J1 ignition feed stud, through the key switch (24) and
                        circuit 13A to 5 amp fuse F5.

                    <para>Terminal #5 is grounded by circuit 11-GL/97-GA through ECM connector (320) terminal #2.</para>
