            <para>A diagnostic check may be performed using the Diagnostic ON/OFF switch and Idle/Diagnostic INC/DEC
                switch. Any error codes will be flashed through the red and yellow warning lights. If no errors are
                found, both lights will stay on while the diagnostics switch is on. Consult the Cummins Operation and
                Maintenance Manual furnished with the vehicle for exact procedures and fault code information.
