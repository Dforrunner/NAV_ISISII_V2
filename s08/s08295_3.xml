            <title>Twelve Volt Power Distribution (Battery)</title>
            <para>Power is supplied by the vehicle batteries to the engine Electronic Control Module (ECM2) over battery
                cable circuit 14A, a 50A fuse, circuit 14B, battery/engine harness connector (411) and circuit 14B/97JA
                to the ECM module power relay (590B). Power is also supplied to the electronic device power stud through
                the battery cable circuit 14D, a 20A fuse, circuit 14C, connector (411), circuit 14J, dash connector (2)
                and circuit 14J. Also, power is supplied through circuit 14B/97LB to the IDM power relay (590A).
            </para>
            <para>Power is also supplied by the vehicle batteries to the cranking motor solenoid battery stud (B) by a
                2/0 wire. From the (B) stud, power is applied to circuits 90-FL/90/90B, fuse F21, circuit 90C and the
                hydraulic brake switch and circuit 97DK to brake/cruise interface relay, circuit 18-FL/18 and the glow
                plug magnetic switch, and circuit 14-FL/14A-FL/14/14M to the cowl junction feed stud and the fused power
                distribution center (590).
            </para>
            <para>From the cowl junction feed stud, power is supplied through circuit 14H, fuse F24, to the horn
                circuitry, and fuse F23, to the body builder battery power circuitry. Power is also applied from the
                cowl junction feed stud through circuit 14K to the ignition relay (R20) and fuse F38, to the fuel heater
                relay circuitry and fuse F36, to the LCT XMSN module circuitry. The power distribution center (590)
                supplies power to the key switch (63) circuitry and the ignition relay (4G) on circuit 15, and to the
                start relay (590B) on circuit 17C. Power is also distributed to the cab fuse panel through circuits 14E
                and 14F.
            </para>
            <para>The alternator supplies power over circuit 2/2-FL and 2A-FL to the cranking motor solenoid (B) stud.
            </para>

        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Twelve Volt Power Distribution (Key Switch)</title>
            <para>Power is fed to the key switch (63) from the cowl power distribution center (590) through fuse F31,
                circuits 15/15A and 15/15B, dash connector (2), circuit 15A/15D and circuit 15B/15D.
            </para>
            <para>When the key switch is in the on or accessory position, power is supplied to circuit 12 going to the
                cab power distribution center and also circuit 1 going to the instrument panel alternator light.
            </para>
            <para>When the key switch is in the on or start position, power is supplied to circuit 13C and the ignition
                relay (4G). The relay is grounded through 13-G/11-GB to the cab ground. This energizes the relay and
                allows power to flow through fuse F31, circuit 15/15C, dash connector (2), circuit 15C, the relay
                contacts, and circuits 13 and 13A to the cab fuse panel.
            </para>
            <para>When the key switch is in the start position, power is also supplied to the crank inhibit relay (4H)
                through circuit 17, the start interrupt connector (195) and circuit 17A.
