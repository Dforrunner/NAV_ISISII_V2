        <para>Undercharged batteries are caused by one or a combination of the following:</para>
        <step1>
            <para count="1">Loose or missing belts; corroded, broken, loose, or dirty terminals; broken wiring;
                undersize wiring (2/0 cable recommended); defective batteries.

        </step1>
        <step1>
            <para count="1">Wrong pulley ratio for application. Pulley ratio is determined by outside diameter of
                crankshaft pulley divided by outside diameter of alternator pulley. Most heavy duty applications require
                a pulley ratio of 2.5 or greater. A ratio of 3.0 is recommended for applications requiring high idle
                operations.
