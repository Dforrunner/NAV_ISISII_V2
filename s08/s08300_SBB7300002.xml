            <title>Multiplexing Architecture</title>
            <para>The electrical system on these vehicles has been significantly redesigned. Unlike the electrical
                systems on previous models, which utilized point-to-point wiring for all input signals and output loads,
                this system uses multiplex technology to provide control and communication between major functional
                areas of the vehicle. Multiplexing simply means, communicating multiple pieces of information via a
                single twisted pair of wires (called the data link) without requiring a wire for each piece of
                information. This information could be gauge information such as engine oil pressure, or switch
                information that controls vehicle functions such as headlamps.
            </para>
            <para>The electrical system relies on a collection of electronic circuit modules and software to perform
                vehicle functions instead of implementing similar features using complex wire harness designs with
                electromechanical relays and switches. These electronic module components are connected together by data
                links. The data links can be thought of as computer networks that allow the electronic components on the
                vehicle to communicate with one another.
            </para>
            <para>The concept of multiplexing is not new since data links for communicating between engine controllers,
                the instrument cluster and the diagnostic connector have been used for several years.
            </para>
            <para>The goal of multiplexing is to reduce cab harness wiring and to simplify circuits. This is
                accomplished by using a low current data link for communicating between cab switches, the Electrical
                System Controller and the Instrument Cluster. Other data links in the vehicle allow other electrical
                controllers, the ESC and the Instrument Cluster to communicate with each other.
