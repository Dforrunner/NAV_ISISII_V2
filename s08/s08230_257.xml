        <para>Power is applied from battery feed block (J1) to circuit 14A, fuse F9, and circuit 70 to the stop light
            switch connector (11). Applying the brakes closes the switch contact and power flows through the switch and
            circuit 70A to a splice. From the splice, a voltage signal is applied to ECM (379) through circuits 97M and
            97N and dash connector (3). This signals the ECM that the brakes have been applied. The ECM uses this
            information to control various operations of the vehicle such as cruise and PTO controls, etc.
        </para>
        <para>From the splice, power also flows through circuit 70E to the stop light relay (660). The relay coil is
            grounded through circuit 97-GH/11-GN to cab ground. This energizes the relay.
        </para>
        <para>Voltage is also applied from fuse F9 through circuit 70A to the stop light relay (660). With the relay
            energized, power is supplied through the relay switch contacts and circuit 70B to the turn signal switch.
