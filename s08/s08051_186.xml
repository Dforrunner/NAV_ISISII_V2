        <title>DAYTIME RUNNING LIGHTS (DRL) MODULE WIRING-USA</title>
        <para>The USA daytime running light system uses an electronic module to control the lights. Power flows from the
            B1 battery adapter (497) through circuit 14BL, fuse F10-B, and circuit 66A to the DRL module (513). The
            ground circuit is made up of 66-GA and 66-G to ground adapter (453). When the ignition key is turned to
            accessories or (ignition) position, power flows from I2 ignition adapter (495) through circuit 13BL, fuse
            F10-A, and circuit 66D to the DRL module (513). When the park brake is applied, the park brake switch (468)
            is closed and power flows through fuse F4-A, circuit 13V, 28C, park brake lamp (420), circuit 44, 44A, 44B,
            DRL park brake switch, circuit 44-GB, and 66-G to ground adapter (453). When the park brake is released, the
            DRL park brake switch opens and the voltage that the DRL module senses at connector (513) terminal E goes to
            121.5V. This tells the module to power the low beam elements of the headlights at 75-80% of normal low beam
            brightness. When the headlight switch is turned ON, the brightness will go to 100%. If low beam lamps are
            selected, fog lights can be turned ON. If high beams are selected, fog lights will not illuminate even if
            switch is set to position.
