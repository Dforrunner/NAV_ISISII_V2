        <title>ENGINE OIL TEMPERATURE GAUGE</title>
        <para>The engine oil temperature gauge is a 3-pin electrical gauge. The gauge is located in the left gauge
            cluster. The gauge cluster receives 12V ignition power from 10A fuse F4-A on circuit 28A at connector (423).
            The cluster contains a printed circuit board which the engine oil temperature gauge plugs into.
        </para>
        <para>The "I" gauge terminal receives ignition voltage through the cluster printed circuit board. The "G" gauge
            terminal is grounded through the cluster connector (423) terminal 4 on circuits 11-GM/11-GQ/11-GF at the
            ground stud located at the left dash panel.
        </para>
        <para>The "S" gauge terminal is connected through connector (423) terminal 18, circuit 30 to the gauge sender.
            The gauge sender is grounded through the engine harness to the engine ground stud. The sender acts like a
            variable resistor. When the oil temperature is high, resistance is LOW and when the oil temperature is low,
            resistance is HIGH. The change in circuit resistance provides the input to the gauge.
