        <para>For electric and air service doors:</para>
        <para>When the door open switch is closed the electronic system controller will supply a ground signal on
            connector (1600) pin 11. This will allow voltage from the ignition/accessory feed splice-20 to power the
            open service door solenoid.
        </para>
        <para>When the door close switch is closed the electronic system controller will supply a ground signal on
            connector (1602) pin 17. This will allow voltage from the ignition/accessory feed splice-20 to power the
            close service door solenoid.
        </para>
        <para>The step light relay is charged whenever the service door open switch is closed. The ground signal
            supplied on system controller connector (1600) pin 11 will charge the step light relay with voltage from the
            ignition/accessory feed splice-20. Voltage from the step light power source will then be applied to the step
            light turning it on. The step light will remain on until the close service door circuits are activated.
        </para>
        <para>For manual service door:</para>
        <para>When the manual service door is opened the manual door switch will close charging the manual door relay
            and the step light relay. The zero volt reference signal will then flow from ESC connector (1600) pin 3 to
            through the closed manual door relay to the ESC connector (1600) pin 26. This will tell the ESC that the
            manual service door is opened. Likewise voltage from the step light connector J183 will flow through the
            closed step light relay to power the step light and the skirt light.
        </para>
        <para>When the manual service door is closed the manual door switch will open creating an open circuit in the
            manual door relay charging circuit.
        </para>
        <para>Ground for the manual door relay and the step light relay is provided from the ground stud on the flasher
            plate.
