            <para>All PEEC and 3176 equipped vehicles have a yellow "Engine Warning" light located in the instrument
                cluster. This light communicates engine status.
            </para>
            <para>During normal vehicle startup, turning the key to the ON position causes the Engine Warning light to
                come on as a system test. It remains on for about 6 seconds, then goes off. If the Engine Warning light
                stays on after the initial startup, the ECM has detected a problem with the engine.
            </para>
            <para>If during vehicle operation, the Engine Warning light comes on, it indicates that an active fault is
                present. The light will remain on, but blink approximately every 5 seconds for a brief 1/2 second.
