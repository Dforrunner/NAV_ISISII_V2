        <title>Hydraulic Brake system</title>
        <para>The Bendix Hydro-Max II hydraulic brake booster is offered on all hydraulic brake models. It powers a
            split system which protects against brake failure by using separate fluid lines to feed the front and rear
            axle brakes. The master cylinder provides fluid pressurized by the power steering pump and the Hydro-Max II
            booster to activate the brake pads against the disc or drums. It is a dual mode system which will
            automatically provide back-up brake power, from an electric/hydraulic pump, should there be a loss of power
            steering pump pressure.
        </para>
        <para>A warning light and alarm, which can indicate various hydraulic and electrical malfunctions, are standard.
            A hydraulic brake/stop light switch assembly signals the engine electronic control module (ECM) and
            energizes the stop light relay and the stop lights. The ECM uses this signal to control the PTO cruise
            control, compression brake, vehicle retarder, cold ambient protection and idle shutdown timer systems.
