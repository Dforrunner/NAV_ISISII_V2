            <title>Horn</title>
            <para>The dual electric horns (high and low note), located on the front side of the left platform support,
                provide a means for the driver to signal or provide warning.

            <title>Air Dryer with Heater</title>
            <para>The function of the air dryer is to collect moisture and contaminants in the air system before it
                reaches the first reservoir. This will provide for moisture-free air for the air brake system. The
                heater in the air dryer prevents freeze-up in the purge drain valve during cold weather.

            <title>Body Connections</title>
            <para>The purpose of the body connectors is to provide connections of the body lighting circuits and the
                chassis circuitry.
            </para>
        </svcsubproc>
        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Automatic Drain Valve with Heater</title>
            <para>The function of the automatic drain valve is to automatically expel accumulated moisture from the air
                tank. The heater in the drain valve prevents freeze-up during cold weather operation.
            </para>

        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Heated Fuel Filter/Water-In-Fuel</title>
            <para>The fuel filter heater is mounted in the fuel filter and when operating, it helps prevent fuel from
                gelling up in the unfiltered side of the filter. The system consists of a fuel heater relay, the filter
                heating element, and a normally open thermo switch. The switch contacts close at approximately 50&#176;F
                (10&#176;C).
            </para>
            <para>The water-in-fuel system consists of a control module, a water probe, and a warning light in the dash
                cluster. When water is present in the fuel filter, increased current will flow from the probe to ground.
                The module senses this increase and turns on the warning light. The system also conducts a bulb check
                when the key switch is in the start position to verify the light operates.
            </para>

        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Hydraulic Brakes</title>
            <para>The Bendix Hydro-Max II hydraulic brake booster is offered on all hydraulic brake models. It powers a
                split system which protects against brake failure by using separate fluid lines to feed the front and
                rear axle brakes. The master cylinder provides fluid pressurized by the power steering pump and the
                Hydro-Max II booster to activate the brake pads against the disc brakes. It is a dual mode system which
                will automatically provide back-up brake power, from an electric/hydraulic pump, should there be a loss
                of power steering pump pressure.
            </para>
            <para>A warning light and alarm, which can indicate various hydraulic and electrical malfunctions, are
                standard.
            </para>
        </svcsubproc>
        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Stop Light Switch (Air Brakes)</title>
            <para>The stop light switch circuit controls voltage to the body builder connector (169) and is used by the
                body builder stop light circuits.
            </para>
        </svcsubproc>
        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Allison AT Automatic Transmission</title>
            <para>With the Allison electrically controlled transmission, the shift modulator valve is controlled by the
                ECM. The system consists of a modulator solenoid relay and modulator shift solenoid. A neutral position
                switch is also provided to prevent the truck from being started in drive gear.
