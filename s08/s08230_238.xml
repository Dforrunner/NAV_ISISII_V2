        <title>Headlight System Without DRL, With International Turn Signal Switch, and Without International Engine
        </title>
        <para>Power is supplied to (J1) junction block, circuit 14F, fuse F26, circuit 50, and circuit 50B to the
            headlight switch (35). Power is also supplied to the flash-to-pass relay (273) contacts and coil by circuits
            50D and 50C, respectively.
        </para>
        <para>When the turn signal lever-mounted dimmer switch is in the low beam position (pushed forward and
            released), and the headlight switch (35) is moved to the headlight on or park positions, power from J1 flows
            through circuit 14E, fuse 24, circuit 50A, headlight switch (35) (in terminal 5, out terminal 4), circuit
            51C, energizes the coil of the lift-to-dim headlight relay (274), circuit 51D, connector (458), the dimmer
            switch, connector (458), circuit 51-G, and circuit 11-G to cab ground. This energizes the relay and allows
            power to flow through circuit 51A, the N.O. contacts of relay (274), circuits 53A, 53, connector (2) and 53
            to a splice.
        </para>
        <para>From the splice, power flows through circuit 53B to the left headlight (502) low beam element. The ground
            path is through circuits 11-GC, 11-GB, connector (2), and circuit 11-GB to cab ground. This causes the
            headlight dim element to illuminate.
        </para>
        <para>From the splice, power also flows through circuit 53A to the right headlight (504) low beam element. The
            ground path is through circuits 11-GE, 11-GB, connector (2), and circuit 11-GB to cab ground. This causes
            the headlight dim element to illuminate.
        </para>
        <para>When the turn signal lever-mounted dimmer switch is moved to the high beam position (lifted), the ground
            path circuit 51D for relay (274) is opened up. This causes the relay to de-energize and allows power to flow
            through the relay N.C. contacts. Thus, power flows through circuits 52C, 52, connector (2), and circuit 52
            to a splice.
        </para>
        <para>From the splice, power flows through circuit 52C to the left headlight (502) high beam element. The ground
            path is through circuits 11-GC, 11-GB, connector (2), and circuit 11-GB to cab ground. This causes the
            headlight bright element to illuminate.
        </para>
        <para>From the splice, power also flows through circuit 52B to the right headlight (504) high beam element. The
            ground path is through circuits 11-GE, 11-GB, connector (2), and circuit 11-GB to cab ground. This causes
            the headlight bright element to illuminate.
        </para>
        <para>When the turn signal lever dimmer switch is pushed and held forward from the dim position, a ground
            circuit is applied to the flash-to-pass relay (273) coil by way of circuit 51E, connector (458), dimmer
            switch, connector (458), circuit 51-G, and 11-G to cab ground.
        </para>
        <para>This energizes relay (273) and causes power to flow from fuse F26 through circuits 50, 50D, relay (273)
            N.O. contacts, circuits 52E, 52, connector (2) and circuit 52 to a splice. From the splice, power flows
            through circuit 52C to the left headlight high beam element, and 52B to the right headlight high beam
            element. Thus, the headlight high beam elements are flashed, signaling the driver's intent to pass. The
            ground circuits were described earlier.
