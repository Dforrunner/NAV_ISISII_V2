                <emph type="bold">Electronic Control Module (ECM) -</emph>
                The ECM receives 12 volt battery power from the vehicle batteries and sends low voltage signals (5 volt)
                to the system components. The system components then ground back through the ECM.
            </para>
            <para>The ECM receives 12 volt battery power from the ECM Power Connector (225) on circuits 97 and 97A.
                There are two 10 AMP Cummins fuses to protect the ECM. The ECM is grounded to the starter terminal on
                circuit 97-G.
            </para>
            <para>The ECM 9-way connector (251) also receives ignition power (circuit 13D) from circuit breaker D3 (5
                AMP).
            </para>
            <para>The signals from the ECM to the system switches and components are from ECM terminal #10 on circuit
                97WZ(5V) to a slice in the cab overlay harness where the signal is then distributed to the individual
                devices. The ECM has two connectors, a 9-pin connector and a 28-pin connector, that are used for
                International connections.

                <emph type="bold">Instrument Cluster Warning Lights -</emph>
                The "Oil/Water," "Engine Warning" and "Engine Stop" lights receive ignition power from J1 Ignition
                Connector on circuit 28A. The warning lights ground to the ECM (terminals 1, 25 &#38; 16). The ECM turns
                the lights on or off in response to engine conditions by closing or opening the ground path. See
