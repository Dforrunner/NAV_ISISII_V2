            <title>RED Terminal - Stop Light</title>
            <para>When the tractor brakes are applied, the vehicle stoplight switch supplies power through circuit
                70A/70D to energize the Stop Light Relay (464-R10). With the Stop Light Relay energized, power from the
                B1 battery Stud, circuit 14K/14F, fuse F7-D, and circuit 70E is sent through the normally open contacts
                of Stop Light Relay on circuit 70C to trailer socket connector (112) at
                <emph type="bold">RED</emph>terminal.

            <title>YELLOW &#38; GREEN Terminals - Turn and Hazard Lights</title>
            <para>In the LEFT TURN mode (or hazard switch ON), power flows from B1 Battery Stud through circuit 14K,
                14R, fuse F2-D, circuit 55, Flasher, circuit 55A and 14BK to Turn Signal Switch. From the switch it
                flows through circuit 56E to energize relay (464-R11). With the Left Turn Relay energized, power flows
                from B1 battery Stud through circuit 14K, 14L, fuse F7-B, circuit 56H, through normally open contacts of
                Left Turn Relay, and circuit 56C to the trailer socket (112),

                flows through circuit 57E to energize relay (464-R12). With the Right Turn Relay energized, power flows
                from B1 battery Stud through circuit 14K, 14L, fuse F7-C, circuit 57H, through normally open contacts of
                Right Turn Relay, and circuit 57C to the trailer socket (112),

            <title>BROWN Terminal - Tail Light</title>
            <para>When the headlight and trailer light switches are closed, power flows from B2 battery stud through
                circuit 14H, 14D, fuse F8-A, and circuit 50 to headlight switch (465). It then flows out of the switch
                through circuit 58E, cab and trailer lights switch (466), and circuit 58P to energize tail light relay
                (464-R9). When relay energizes, power flows from B2 battery stud through circuit 14H, 14B, fuse F3-C,
                and circuit 68 to tail light relay. Power then flows through relay normally open contacts, circuit 68E,
                and 68B to the
                <emph type="bold">Brown</emph>
                terminal of trailer socket (112).

                through circuit 58E, cab and trailer lights switch (466), and circuit 58C to energize trailer marker
                lights relay (463-R8). When relay energizes, power flows from B2 battery stud through circuit 14H, 14E,
                fuse F3-A, circuit 58D, relay (463-R8), circuit 58R, 58S, and 58R to the trailer socket
