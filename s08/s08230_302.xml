        <para>Power is supplied to (J2) accessory feed block, circuit 12B, fuse F19 and circuit 75A to the fan control
            switch (36). When switch (36) is moved to the low speed position, power flows from the switch through
            circuit 75D, both resistors, and the thermo fuse of the resistor and thermo fuse assembly (44), circuit 75E,
            blower relay (73) N.C. contacts and circuit 75F to blower motor (210). This causes the blower motor to run
            at low speed. The ground path for the blower motor is circuit 75-G/11-GE to relay bracket ground and
            11-GC/11-GA/11-GF to cab ground.
        </para>
        <para>When switch (36) is moved to the medium speed position, power flows from the switch through circuit 75C,
            one resistor and the thermo fuse of the resistor and thermo fuse assembly (44), circuit 75E, blower relay
            (73) N.C. contacts, and circuit 75F to blower motor (210). This causes the blower motor to run at medium
            speed.
        </para>
        <para>When switch (36) is moved to the high speed position, power flows from the switch, through circuit 75B,
            the coil of blower relay (73), circuit 75-GA/11-GE, relay bracket ground, circuit 11-GC/11-GA/11-GF to cab
            ground. This energizes relay (73) and allows power to flow from junction block (J1) through circuit 14B,
            fuse F12, circuit 75, N.O. contacts of relay (73) and circuit 75F to blower motor (210). This causes the
            blower motor to run at high speed.
