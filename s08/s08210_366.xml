            <para>When the ignition switch is on, power is applied to circuit 75BR of HVAC control connector (1057).
                When the AC button is pushed in or the defrost mode is selected, 12 volts will be applied from connector
                (1057) on circuit 77W (and also through a diode and circuit 77S on models with AC control in the
                sleeper) to energize A/C control relay (144).
            </para>
            <para>If the vehicle is equipped with a sleeper A/C On/Off switch, A/C control relay (144) can also be
                energized when the bunk heater blower switch (593) is not in the off position and the sleeper A/C switch
                (905) is on. The switch will illuminate when it is on. Power flows from switch (593) on circuits 77L,
                77AB and 77AC through switch (905) to circuits 77M and 77K to energize the relay.
            </para>
            <para>Power from fuse F1-B will flow through the relay on circuit 77H to connector (162) of the heater box
                pigtail. From (162) it can flow through circuit 77C and 77P to feed the low pressure safety switch,
                circuits 77C and 77N to feed the high pressure safety switch, and 77B to feed the thermal switch. If the
                refrigerant pressure is greater than the low pressure cut off switch, and less than the high pressure
                cut off switch, circuit 77R will not have power applied. Thus, A/C relay (463-R6) normally closed (N.C.)
                contacts remain closed and while the thermal switch contacts remain closed, power will flow from the
                thermal switch through circuit 77F, A/C relay (463-R6) contacts, and circuit 77C to energize the
                refrigerant compressor clutch.
            </para>
            <para>When the evaporator temperature cools to below 30&#176; &#177; 2&#176; (-1&#176; &#177; 1&#176;C), the
                thermal switch contacts will open cutting off the flow of power to the compressor clutch. This will keep
                the evaporator from freezing over. If either of the safety pressure switches close, the A/C relay will
                energize and its contacts will open breaking power to the compressor clutch.
            </para>
            <para>With the air conditioning relay (463-R6) energized, power is interrupted to the refrigerant compressor
                clutch. Thus, the compressor is shut down, and will not restart until the refrigerant pressure is back
                within operating range.
