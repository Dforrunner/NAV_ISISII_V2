        <para>When the work light switch is moved to the position, power flows from the B2 battery stud through circuit
            14T, fuse F2-A, circuit 65A, work light switch (441), and circuit 65B to fuse L4. From the fuse power flows
            on circuit 65E to the left work light, and 65F to the right work light. The ground path is circuit 11T to
            11F and sleeper ground for the left work light, and circuit 11S, 11T, and 11F to sleeper ground for the
            right work light. With the work light switch in the position, power also flows from fuse F4-A through
            circuits 13V, 28A, work light indicator light, circuit 65C, work light switch, and circuit 65-GC, 11-GBD,
            and 11-GBE to ground adapter (454), thus indicating that the work light switch is turned ON.
