                circuits 28 and 28B, the green cluster connector (11), and the cluster printed circuit board. The gauge
                is grounded through the printed circuit board, the green connector (11), circuits 28-G, 11-GB, and 11-G
                to the platform ground.

            <title>Brake Pressure Warning Light and Alarm - With Air Brake System</title>
            <para>When the key switch (20) is turned on, power is applied to circuit 13/13F, fuse F22, circuit 28/28D,
                dash connector (12), the instrument cluster printed circuit board, the brake warning light, the circuit
                board, connector (12), circuit 40A, and to the fast mode side of alarm (211).
            </para>
            <para>When the vehicle is started and the air pressure is below 60 psi, the air pressure switch (1LA) is
                closed and provides a ground path for the alarm and warning light through circuit 40, the
                platform/chassis connector (2), circuit 40, the chassis/engine harness connector (196), circuit 40, and
                through the closed air pressure switch (1LA) which is grounded through its mounting.

        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Hydraulic Brake Low Fluid and Parking Brake Warning Lights</title>
            <para>When the key switch (20) is turned to the on position, power is supplied to the low brake fluid
                warning system through circuit 28, to a splice, circuit 90R, the low level fluid warning light (89),
                circuit 90V, to a splice, platform/ chassis connector (2) and (90A), and circuit 90P to the normally
                open sensor switch (90). When a low brake fluid level is encountered, the sensor switch closes and the
                circuit ground is through the switch and circuit 11-GF/11-GB to the platform ground.
            </para>
            <para>When the key switch is turned to the start position, a momentary ground is applied through the key
                switch, circuit 31-GD, circuit 44-G, brake diode assembly (82), circuit 90W to the previously mentioned
                splice, and circuit 90V to the fluid level warning bulb. This causes the warning light to come on as a
                bulb check and goes off when the key is released from the start position.
            </para>
            <para>Power is also applied to the parking brake warning system through circuit 28/28C, connector (12-8), to
                the warning light, connector (12-17), circuit 44, brake diode assembly connector (82) and circuit 44A to
                the normally open parking brake switch (218). When the parking brake is applied, the switch contacts
                close and completes the circuit through the switch and circuit 44-GA/11-GB/11-G to the platform ground.
            </para>
            <para>When the key is turned to the start position, a ground is applied to the circuitry through the
                ignition switch, circuit 31-GD, circuit 44-G, brake diode assembly (82) and circuit 44 to the park brake
                bulb. This causes the warning light to come on as a bulb check and goes off when the key is released
                from the start position.

            <title>Transmission Oil Temperature Warning Light</title>
            <para>With the key switch (20) in the on position, power is available at the transmission warning light
                switch through fuse F22, circuit 28/28E, the warning light, and circuit 31 to platform harness connector
                (2). The circuitry continues through circuit 31, the chassis/engine harness connector (196) and circuit
                31 to the temperature switch terminal.
            </para>
            <para>When the transmission oil temperature reaches 305&#176;F (151.7&#176;C) or more, the switch contacts
                close and completes the ground path. This causes the warning light to come on.
            </para>
        </svcsubproc>
        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Change Transmission Filter Warning Light</title>
            <para>With the key switch in the on position, power is available at the automatic transmission fuel filter
                connector (344) through fuse F10, circuit 31D, Pall filter warning light connector (94), and circuit
                31-GA. The circuitry continues through a blue wire in the jumper harness which connects to the black
                wire of the filter pigtail.
            </para>
            <para>When the key switch is turned to the start position, the circuit is momentarily grounded through the
                filter pressure differential switch contacts, the switch pigtail white wire, the green wire of the
                jumper harness, and the filter connector (344). The ground path continues through circuit 31-GB,
                rectifier assembly (64), circuit 31-GC, an inline connector (N/L), and circuit 31-GD to the key switch
                (20) ground. This activates the warning light and serves as a bulb operating check when starting the
                vehicle.
            </para>
            <para>When the flow of oil through the filter is restricted, the filter pressure differential switch is
                activated. This grounds the warning light through the switch contacts, the red wire of the pigtail, the
                brown wire of the jumper harness, connector (344) and circuit 11-GE to the platform ground.
