        <title>Horton Fan With Cummins ISM With or Without Air Conditioning</title>
        <para>The Cummins ECM controls the cooling fan clutch by supplying 12 volts at 31-way interface connector (957)
            pin 12. This power is transferred through the Cummins engine harness, 31-way interface connector (957), and
            circuit 23D to connector (239) and the red wire of the fan solenoid, causing it to energize. With the
            solenoid energized, the air supply to the fan clutch will come on, and thus the fan stops. The fan solenoid
            is grounded through the black wire and connector (239) of the solenoid, and circuits 23-GA to 31-way
            interface connector (957) pin 13.
        </para>
        <para>The ECM cycles the fan to regulate engine temperature and A/C compressor head refrigerant pressure. The
            ECM uses temperature sensors on the engine and input from the A/C pressure switch (240) to determine these
            on/off cycles. This input is the application of a ground signal which originates from ECM connector (957)
            pin 18 and is applied to circuit 23-GB, A/C switch or jumper at connector (240), circuit 23C, and 31-way
            interface connector (957) pin 17. The A/C pressure switch is a N.C. switch that opens up at pressures
            greater the 300 psi, and thus signals the ECM, by removing the ground signal, to turn on the engine fan.
