                <hotlnk document="s08313_2.xml" xrefid="f0831301">Figure 1, Item 1.A</hotlnk>) and red lens provide a
                warning, to driver of the vehicle, that the engine's oil pressure is running low, that its coolant
                temperature is running high, or the coolant level is low (with electronic engines). Thus the driver can
                take the necessary actions to protect the engine. This light is also used with International engines to
                signal that the engine is going to shut down in 30 seconds due to either idle shutdown counter or engine
                protection system.
