        <para>Power is supplied to junction block (J1) to circuit 14A, fuse F9, circuit 70 and air operated stop light
            switch (11). When the service brakes are applied, the contacts of switch (11) close and power is applied to
            circuits 70A/70B, and turn signal switch (422) and circuits 70A/70D to stop light relay (R4). This energizes
            stop light relay (R4) as current flows through its coil and ground circuit 70-G/11-G to cab ground. With
            (R4) energized, power is applied from junction block (J1) to circuit 14S/14J, fuse F29, circuit 70C and
            relay (R4) N.O. contacts. Power is also applied to circuits 70F/70E, and trailer connector (160) and
            circuits 70F/70H, and trailer connector (183).
