                <emph type="bold">Index Fan Switch (226) -</emph>The Index fan switch (226) receives ignition voltage
                from 10A fuse F9-A on circuit 23. The switch is grounded by circuit 23-G. The fan temperature switch
                opens (turning fan ON) when engine temperature exceeds 205&#176;F or if the air conditioning (A/C)
                compressor head pressure exceeds 270 psi. When engine temperature drops below 198&#176;F (or head
                pressure drops below 255 psi) the fan will remain ON for 3 more minutes (to prevent rapid fan cycling)
                then turn OFF.

            <para>A. Fan OFF</para>
            <para>The switch is closed when engine temperature is less than 198&#176;F. With the switch closed ignition
                power is applied through circuit 23D (23E with Caterpillar 3406E) to energize the normally open
                solenoid. With the solenoid energized (closed) air pressure is removed from the fan clutch causing the
                clutch to disengage (Horton fan is spring loaded OFF).

                        OFF power to the fan solenoid. With the solenoid de-energized air pressure is applied to the fan
                        clutch causing the fan to engage after a 3 minute time delay.

                        compressor. The pressure switch is normally closed, grounding the fan temperature switch. If
                        compressor head pressure exceeds 270 psi, the switch opens the ground path from the fan
                        temperature switch, which opens the fan temperature switch turning OFF the power to the fan
                        solenoid. With the solenoid de-energized air pressure is applied to the fan clutch causing the
                        fan to engage after a 3 minute time delay.
