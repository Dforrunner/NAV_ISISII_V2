            <hotlnk document="s08012_7.xml" xrefid="f0801208">Figure 8</hotlnk>) the brush holder and regulator may be
            replaced by removing the two remaining screws. Note the two insulators located over the top of the brush
            clips in
            <hotlnk document="s08012_6.xml" xrefid="f0801206">Figure 6</hotlnk>. These two screws have special
            insulating sleeves over the screw body above the threads. The third mounting screw may or may not have an
            insulating sleeve. If not, this screw must not be interchanged with either one of the other two screws, as a
            ground may result, causing no output. Regulators may vary in appearance but are completely interchangeable.
