        <title>IDLE SHUTDOWN</title>
        <svcprocinfo>
            <para>The custom selectable idle shutdown feature shuts down the engine (not power to the cab) after a
                customer selected (programmed) length of time (3 to 100 minutes). The timer begins counting down from
                the customer selected maximum idle time when: the parking brake is set, the engine is up to operating
                temperature, the engine is at idle and the ECM does not see any clutch pedal or brake pedal activity. If
                these conditions are present, the ECM counts down the "customer selected" time until ninety seconds
                before the scheduled engine shutdown is to occur. At this time (ninety seconds before shutdown), the
                yellow Check Engine Light (CEL) begins to flash rapidly. During this 90-second time frame, depressing
                the clutch or applying throttle will
                <emph type="bold">cancel</emph>
                the shutdown.

            <title>Idle Shutdown Park Brake Applied Switch (328)</title>
            <para>This switch receives a signal from the ECM terminal H2. Applying the Park Brake closes the switch,
                completing the circuit to ground. Grounding terminal H2 signals to the ECM that the park brake is set.
