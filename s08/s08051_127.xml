            <para>This section includes troubleshooting charts for International installed circuits and components that
                are part of the CELECT Electronic Control system. To begin the troubleshooting process, refer to the
                appropriate Cummins manual and follow their directions. If the Cummins diagnostics (fault codes)
                indicate that the suspect circuits are International circuits or components, then use the charts in this
                section.
            </para>
            <para>The Pro-Link DDR can also be used to determine if the International switches and components are
                working properly. If they are not, use a Fluke digital multimeter (DMM) to troubleshoot the circuits.
            </para>
            <para>If the CELECT diagnostic codes or the Pro-Link indicates a problem with International installed
                circuits, the flow charts in this chapter provide step-by-step test procedures.

                    <para>Before beginning these test procedures, make sure the vehicle batteries are at 75% state of
                        charge (SOC) or higher. This represents an open circuit voltage (OCV) of 12.4 volts. Batteries
                        with an OCV of 12 volts or less are either completely discharged or have a dead cell.

                    <para>Before beginning these test procedures, check any light or indicator lamp filaments that are
                        suspected of being open (burned out). This is done to avoid unnecessary extensive circuit
                        checks.

                    <para>Before beginning these test procedures, inspect all connectors for loose or damaged pins,
                        wires, etc. Refer to Introduction and Connector Repair section in in the CTS-5000 Master Service
                        Manual.

                    <para>When the mechanic determines that a fuse is blown, while checking its condition, he is
                        directed to locate the cause of the overload condition and to repair it. While no further
                        instruction on this procedure is listed in the diagnostic tables, the common procedure is as
                        follows: isolate sections of the circuit, by disconnecting connectors, and measure the
                        resistance to ground to find the circuit that is shorted to ground. Then locate the damaged spot
                        in the wire or connector and repair.

                    <para>Diagnostics for circuits that are malfunctioning by sticking in the position are generally not
                        covered in detail. It is assumed that the mechanic knows to check for a malfunctioning switch,
                        relay, or solenoid.

            <para>All CELECT vehicles have a yellow "Engine Warning" light and a red "Engine Stop" light located in the
                telltale lights in the instrument cluster. Every time the key is turned to the ignition position, the
                lights come ON for several seconds as a system self-test and then turn OFF.

            <para>If the warning lights remain ON, it is an indication that the ECM has detected a problem. The CELECT
                system can show and record certain problems. The problems are shown as fault codes. The fault codes are
                recorded in the ECM.

            <para>If a fault is detected (becomes active) during vehicle operation, the driver is alerted by the
                illumination of either the yellow Engine Warning Light or the red Stop Engine Light. The yellow
                Service/Check Engine Light may also be illuminated.
