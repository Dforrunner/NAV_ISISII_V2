        <title>Electric Window - Right</title>
        <svcprocinfo>
            <para>Refer to ELECTRIC WINDOW - RIGHT circuit diagram in CTS-5119W or CTS-5273W. The right side electric
                window is controlled by the driver's right side window switch. To operate the window, the key must be in
                the on or accessory position. The circuit includes the electric window relay (145), window switch (439)
                and the right window motor. Power to the window switch is supplied from the B1 battery stud to the
                common terminal (30) of the window relay (145). With the key in the on or accessory position, the relay
                is energized applying power to terminal 4 (and internally to terminal 3) at the electric window switch
                (439). Note that switch terminals 4 and 3 are at 12V with key on and terminals 1 and 6 are always at
                ground.

            <title>Window Down Operation</title>
            <para>With the window switch in the down position, power from switch terminal 5 is applied to the motor on
                circuit 83D. Circuit 83C from the motor to the switch terminal 2 becomes the ground circuit. With the
                switch in the down position, switch terminals 2 and 1 are connected, completing the path to ground.

            <title>Window Up Operation</title>
            <para>With the window switch in the up position, power from switch terminal 2 is applied to the motor on
                circuit 83C. Circuit 83D from the motor to the switch terminal 5 becomes the ground circuit. With the
                switch in the up position, switch terminals 5 and 6 are connected, completing the path to ground.
