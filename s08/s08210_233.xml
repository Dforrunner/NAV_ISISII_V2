            <title>CEC Power and Ground</title>
            <para>The CEC receives 12 volt operating power, with the key switch in the ignition position, from the CEC
                power relay. The circuitry is protected by a 40 amp fuse that is part of the battery cable assembly. The
                control module ground is to the negative post of the batteries.
            </para>
            <para>Power is supplied from the batteries to circuit 14A, a 40A power relay fuse, circuit 14B, positive
                battery connector, circuit 14B, power connector (490), and circuit 14B to the Electronic Control Module
                (CEC) power relay (396) contacts.
            </para>
            <para>Power is also supplied from the (B1) battery feed stud to circuit 14BB, fuse F10B, circuit 97DCT,
                circuit 97CT, bulkhead connector (190), and circuit 97CT to the Module power relay coil. From the relay,
                power is applied to circuit 97AH and pin 25 of the CEC (379).
            </para>
            <para>When key switch (24) is moved to the ignition position, power is supplied to circuit 13AA, fuse F10C,
                circuit 97DS, circuit 97CR, bulkhead connector (190), and circuit 97CR to pin 24 of the CEC (379). This
                signals the CEC that the ignition switch is on and causes the CEC to internally switch pin 25 to ground.
                This completes the circuit for the Module power relay (396) and energizes the relay. With the relay
                energized, power is applied through the relay contacts to circuit 97CM and a splice. From the splice
                power is applied to the CEC pins 21, 22, and 41 on circuits 97CL, 97CK, and 97AL respectively.
            </para>
            <para>Grounds for the CEC pins 1, 2, 23, and 42 are through circuits 11-GW, 11-GX, 11-GY, and 11-GZ
                respectively, to a splice. From the splice, ground is through circuit 11-G, the battery harness
                connector (490), circuit 11-G, negative battery connector (665) and circuit 11-G to the negative battery
                terminal.
