        <title>ATA Data Link Connector</title>
        <para>The six pin ATA data link connector (313) allows an electronic service tool (EST) to communicate with the
            ECM. The data link carries serial data transmissions between the ECM and the electronic service tool, and
            between the ECM and the speedo/tachometer cluster. Thus, the ECM provides vehicle and engine information to
            the speedo/tachometer and the EST.
        </para>
        <para>The ATA data link connector (313), which is located on the left instrument panel, has circuits in four of
            the six cavities. The data link circuits are a twisted wire pair because twisting the wires helps shield
            them from interference. The circuits are as follows:
        </para>
        <para>Circuit 98A(+) is the positive data link connection and it is fed by the positive data link connector
            (427), the jumper bus bar, circuit 98(+), connector (3), and circuit 98(+) coming from the ECM connector
            (1091).
        </para>
        <para>Circuit 98C(-) is the negative data link connection and it is fed by the negative data link connector
            (428), the jumper bus bar, circuit 98B(-), connector (3) and circuit 98B(-) coming from the ECM connector
            (1091).
        </para>
        <para>Circuit 97C is a 12 volt feed and is fed from the battery adapter (332), circuit 14B, 14P and 10A fuse
            F11-B. Thus it provides power for the electronic service tool.
        </para>
        <para>Circuit 11-GL is connected to the panel lights ground adapter (2G) and provides a ground for the
            electronic service tool.
