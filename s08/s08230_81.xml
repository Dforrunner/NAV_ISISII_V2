            <title>Standard Engine Protection System</title>
            <para>CELECT PLUS engines are equipped with an engine protection system as a standard feature. This feature
                includes the "red" Oil/Water Warning Light (referred to in Cummins literature as an Engine Protection
                Light). This system monitors important engine parameters and logs diagnostic faults when an over-or
                under-normal operating range condition occurs. The engine protection also derates engine torque and
                engine speed when certain engine fluid parameters pass a limit point.
            </para>
            <para>The ECM also logs the time of the occurrence and other relevant information. This data can be read
                using an Electronic Service Tool (EST).
            </para>
            <para>The red Oil/Water Warning Light will turn on at the occurrence then begin blinking after a period of
                time.
                <emph type="bold">This blinking operation is to warn the driver that the condition has been active for a
                    period of time or else the pressure or temperature condition has become worse.</emph>The Engine
                Protection system monitors:

            <para>With the key on and engine off and with the Diagnostic switch off, the Oil/Water Light will come on

            <title>CELECT Engine Protection Shutdown</title>
            <para>This system is customer selectable and can be enabled using Electronic Service Tools (EST). This
                system will shut down the engine whenever monitored parameters fall outside the operating range.
            </para>
            <para>The engine protection shutdown is triggered when the red Oil/Water Warning Light starts flashing for
                the current engine protection/ warning derate. Once triggered, the engine will shut down after 30
                seconds.
            </para>
            <para>During the 30 second warning period, the standard torque and speed derates will occur.</para>
            <para>The engine can be restarted by cycling the key switch. After the engine is restarted, it will be
                limited to the maximum torque and/or speed derate levels of the out-of-range parameter, if the engine
                protection fault is still active.
            </para>
            <para>If an engine protection fault goes inactive during the 30 second shutdown warning period, the engine
                will return to normal operation and will not shut down.

            <para>With the key on and engine off and with the Diagnostic switch off, the Oil/Water Light will come on
                for two seconds and then turn off as a system test.
