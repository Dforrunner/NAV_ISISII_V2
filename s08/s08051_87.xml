                <emph type="bold">Horton Fan/Clutch Assembly -</emph>The fan clutch is engaged by air pressure supplied
                by the Fan Solenoid. The fan clutch is spring loaded OFF and air pressure is required to overcome the
                spring and engage the clutch.

                <emph type="bold">Normally Open Fan Solenoid (227) -</emph>The N.O. fan solenoid (227) supplies air
                pressure to engage the fan clutch when the solenoid is not energized. Energizing the solenoid turns OFF
                the air pressure to the fan clutch, causing the fan clutch to disengage.

                23-GA is grounded through the engine harness to the cylinder head ground.
