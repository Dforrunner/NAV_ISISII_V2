        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Air Dryer with Air Brakes</title>
            <para>The function of the air dryer is to collect moisture and contaminants in the air system before it
                reaches the first reservoir. This will provide for moisture-free air for the air brake system. The
                heater in the air dryer prevents freeze-up in the purge drain valve during cold weather.

        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Drain Valve</title>
            <para>The function of the automatic drain valve is to automatically expel accumulated moisture from the air
                tank. The heater in the drain valve prevents freeze-up during cold weather operation.
            </para>

        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Heated Fuel Filter With Water-In-Fuel Light, Fuel Filter Restriction Light</title>
            <para>The fuel filter heater is mounted in the fuel filter and when operating, it helps prevent fuel from
                gelling up in the unfiltered side of the filter. The system consists of a fuel heater relay, filter
                heating element, and a normally open thermal switch. The switch contacts close at approximately 50&#176;F
                (10&#176;C).
            </para>
            <para>WATER-IN-FUEL: RE 200 (V8 ENGINE). The water-in-fuel system consists of a control module, a water
                probe, and a warning light in the dash cluster. When water is present in the fuel filter, increased
                current will flow from the probe to ground. The module senses this increase and turns on the warning
                light. The system also conducts a bulb check when the key switch is in the start position to verify that
                the light operates.
            </para>
            <para>WATER-IN-FUEL: RE 300 (I6 ENGINE). The I6 engine ECM2 will turn on the "WATER-IN-FUEL" warning light.
                The battery voltage is through the ignition switch relay (1711), fuse F20, to the MSM1 connector (3114)
                pin 7 and to the WIF connector (3116), pin G, to the WIF connector (3116), pin C, to the "WATER-IN-FUEL"
                warning light (9), pin B. The "WATER-IN-FUEL" indicator is controlled by the ECM2 (6020). The control
                from ECM2 connector (6020), pins 12 and 13, is transferred over the data link on circuits K5AA(+) and
                K5AA(-) through pins 14 and 15 of connector (9850), to the MSM1 connector (3114) pins 5 and 6. A ground
                is sent from the MSM2 connector (3115) through pin 3, to the WIF connector (3116), pin H, to the WIF
                connector (3116), pin B, to the "WATER-IN-FUEL" warning light (9), pin A, thus causing the
                "WATER-IN-FUEL" warning light to illuminate.
            </para>
            <para>The fuel filter restriction light is activated when the fuel filter becomes restricted. This causes
                the fuel filter vacuum switch contacts to close and activates the light.
            </para>
        </svcsubproc>
        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Brake System</title>
            <para>The Bendix Hydro-Max II hydraulic brake booster is offered on all hydraulic brake models. It powers a
                split system which protects against brake failure by using separate fluid lines to feed the front and
                rear axle brakes. The master cylinder provides fluid pressurized by the power steering pump and the
                Hydro-Max II booster to activate the brake pads against the disc brakes. It is a dual mode system which
                will automatically provide back-up brake power, from an electric/hydraulic pump, should there be a loss
                of power steering pump pressure.
            </para>
            <para>A warning light and alarm, which can indicate various hydraulic and electrical malfunctions, are
                standard.
            </para>
