            <para>The troubleshooting guide requires checking specific connectors. Use the following steps to determine
                if the connector is causing the problem. If a defective condition is found, make the necessary
                corrections and continue the process.

            <title>Performing Electrical Tests At International Connection (400) To ECM</title>
            <para>International OEM connector (400) mates with Caterpillar ECM connector J1. This is a Deutsch 40-Pin
                connector, with the International side having female terminals (sockets) and the Caterpillar side having
                pins.

            <para>To construct test leads, attach an insulated alligator clip to a suitable length of 16 gauge wire. On
                the other end, use Deutsch HDT-48-00 Crimp Tool to install male terminal 1651958C1.

            <para>Signal Reading Probes, Caterpillar part number 7X1710, can also be used.</para>

            <title>Replacing International Components</title>
            <para>When replacing electrical switches, connectors (including pins and sockets), relays or other
                components, use only approved International replacement parts. Many of the switches have gold or silver
                plated contacts and some of the connectors have gold plated terminals. By using correct replacement
                parts, you maintain the design integrity of the system.
            </para>
            <para>All of the relays and other solenoids installed by International are suppressed to prevent voltage
                spikes from damaging electrical components. Again, use only International replacements for these
                components.
