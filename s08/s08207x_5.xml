        <para>A single electronically driven alarm is mounted on and plugs into the Speedometer/Tachometer module. The
            alarm is a replaceable item. The alarm generates different tone sequences to alert the driver or service
            technician to the current alarm condition. The alarm will sound, reporting out-of-range conditions in the
            following manner:
