        <title>HORN SINGLE AND DUAL</title>
        <para>Voltage is present at (J1) junction stud, circuit 14R, circuit 14A, fuse F7, circuit 85 and horn relay
            (275). When the horn button is pressed, the horn button switch closes and completes the ground circuit. Then
            current flows through the relay coil, circuit 85A, connector (213), 85A (85-G with Signal-Stat turn signal
            switch), slip ring (J3), circuit 85A, horn button, and circuit 85-GB to steering column ground. With the
            relay coil energized, current flows through the horn relay contacts, circuit 85C, connector (2), circuit 85C
            [connector (441) and circuit 85C with International Electronic engines only], connector (605), and circuit
            85C to the single high note horn.
        </para>
        <para>The ground path is circuit 85-G, connector (605), circuit 11-GL (circuit 85-G with 4000 model) and 11-GB,
            connector (2), and circuit 11-GB to cab ground with non-International electronic engines. With International
            electronic engines, the ground path from connector (605) is circuit 11-GL (85-G with 4000 model) and circuit
            11-GB, connector (425) and circuit 11-GB to starter ground.
        </para>
        <para>With dual horns, power flows through connector (605) circuit 85B, circuit 85C to high note horn and
            circuit 85D to low note horn.
        </para>
        <para>The ground path is circuit 85-GB for the low note horn and 85-GA for the high note horn to circuit 85-G,
            connector (605) and the rest of the ground circuit described for single horn application.
