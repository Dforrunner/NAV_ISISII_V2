            <title>Programmable Parameters</title>
            <para>Certain programmable parameters that affect the engine electronic control systems may be changed with
                electronic service tools (see
                <hotlnk document="s08133_X0813301.xml" xrefid="x0813301">Electronic Service Tools</hotlnk>
                ). The parameters are stored in the system Electronic Control Module (ECM) and are protected from
                unauthorized change by passwords.The programmable parameters are either "System Parameters" or "Customer
                Parameters."
            </para>
            <para>
                <emph type="bold">System Configuration Parameters</emph>
                are set at the factory and affect emissions or horsepower ratings within a family of engines. Factory
                passwords must be obtained and used to change System Configuration Parameters.
            </para>
            <para>
                <emph type="bold">Customer Selectable Parameters</emph>
                are variable, and are used to specify operating parameters for: cruise control, PTO operation, vehicle
                speed limits, progressive shifting, type of engine protection system, RPM and horsepower ratings within
                the engine family. Customer passwords must be used to change Customer Parameters.
            </para>
            <para>Since each control system is electronically programmable to individual owner specifications,
                <emph type="bold">the operating parameters will vary from vehicle to vehicle</emph>. Some of these
                parameters may cause the engine to operate in a way that the driver (or service technician) does not
                expect, if proper training has not taken place. This may lead to power or performance complaints and/or
                service time, when the engine is operating correctly.
            </para>
            <para>EXAMPLE: If the driver attempts to drive 60 mph and the vehicle speed limiting option has been
                programmed to limit vehicle speed to 55 mph, the driver may complain of low power.

            <title>Passwords</title>
            <para>"System Configuration Parameters" are protected by Caterpillar factory passwords.
                <emph type="underscr">Factory passwords are only available to authorized Caterpillar dealers.</emph>
            </para>
            <para>"Customer Parameters" are protected by customer passwords. The customer pass- words are selected by
                the customer and can be changed using electronic service tools.
            </para>
            <para>For complete information on passwords, refer to the appropriate Caterpillar Service Manuals.</para>

        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Self-Diagnostics</title>
            <para>Caterpillar Electronic Engine Control systems have some ability to diagnose their own circuits. When a
                problem condition is detected, a diagnostic code is generated and the Engine Warning light on the
                instrument panel may be turned ON (not all codes cause the light to come ON). In most cases, the code is
                also logged (stored) in the ECM permanent memory. This memory is not lost when turning the vehicle off
                or when disconnecting the batteries.
            </para>
            <para>Codes representing current conditions are called
                <emph type="bold">ACTIVE codes</emph>. They indicate that a problem of some kind currently exists. They
                should always be serviced.
            </para>
            <para>If a fault condition occurred and caused a code to be logged, but is no longer present, the code is
                referred to as an
                <emph type="bold">INACTIVE code</emph>. This can occur with an intermittent condition or even if repairs
                were made, but the code was not cleared. Logged INACTIVE codes don't necessarily mean that something
                requires service. They are meant to be an indicator of intermittent conditions. In addition, some logged
                codes record events, and not faults.
            </para>
            <para>Intermittent codes that don't require a password to clear are automatically cleared after 100 hours of
                ECM operation, if the condition does not happen again.
            </para>
            <para>When an ACTIVE code is logged, the Engine Warning light is turned ON.</para>
