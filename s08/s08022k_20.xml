        <title>FAST CHARGING</title>
        <para>The Fast Charge method provides a high charging rate for a short period of time. The charging rate should
            be limited to 50 amperes for 12-volt batteries.
        </para>
        <para>The battery generally cannot be fully charged with this method, but will receive sufficient charge (70 to
            90%) for practical service. To completely recharge a battery, follow the fast charge with a slow charge
            until no change in specific gravity occurs over a three hour period.
        </para>
        <para>A battery with electrolyte specific gravity of 1.225 or above should never be charged at a high rate. If
            the charger has not tapered to a low rate, adjust to a slow charge, preferably at a rate of one ampere per
            positive plate per cell.
