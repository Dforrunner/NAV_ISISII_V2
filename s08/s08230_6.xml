        <title>12 Volt Power Distribution, Bulb Check (Ground)</title>
        <para>Power is fed to the key switch (24) on circuit 15 from junction block (J1). When the key switch or push
            button is moved to the start position, circuits connected to the ground terminal are switched to ground. On
            vehicles with hydraulic brakes, circuit 44C provides a ground path for circuit 44 (park brake light),
            through blocking diode (383), which tests the lamp.
        </para>
        <para>With International engines, circuit 19N is also connected to the start position terminal and provides a
            ground for testing the Water-In-Fuel light circuitry.
        </para>
        <para>If equipped with daytime running lights, circuit 66H is also switched to ground. This turns off the
            headlights while the engine is cranking.
