        <title>STATOR CHECKS (Omit for Overcharged Battery)</title>
        <para>The stator windings may be checked with an ohmmeter. If the meter reading is low when connected from any
            stator lead to the frame, the windings are grounded (Step 4,
            <hotlnk document="s08013_8.xml" xrefid="f0801308">Figure 8</hotlnk>).
        </para>
        <para>If the meter reading is high when successively connected between each pair of stator leads, the windings
            are open (Step 6,
            <hotlnk document="s08013_8.xml" xrefid="f0801308">Figure 8</hotlnk>). A short circuit in the stator windings
            is difficult to locate without laboratory test equipment due to the low resistance of the windings. However,
            if all other electrical checks are normal and the alternator fails to supply rated output, shorted stator
            windings are indicated.
