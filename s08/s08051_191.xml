        <title>HEADLIGHTS ON 9300 W/CANADA DRL</title>
        <para>The 9300 model trucks built with Canadian DRL utilize an additional relay called the DRL headlight relay.
            This relay enables the lower headlights on the left and right sides to be powered in series without the
            upper headlights receiving power.
        </para>
        <para>In the low beam mode, power flows on circuit 53B and is split up on 53C for the right upper light and 53D
            for the left upper light. In the high beam mode, power flows on circuit 52F where it splits to go to the
            left upper headlight on 52D, the right upper headlight on 52E, and the DRL on 52A. This energizes the DRL
            headlight relay (569) by way of circuits 52B and 52-GB to J7 cab ground. With the DRL headlight relay
            energized, power also flows through the relay, and through circuit 52H where it is split up on 52K for the
            right lower headlight and 52J for left lower headlight.
        </para>
        <para>The left upper headlight is grounded through circuits 53-G, and 52-GA to J7 cab ground. The right upper
            headlight is grounded through circuits 53-GA and 52-GD to J7 cab ground. The right lower headlight is
            grounded through circuits 52-GF, and 52-GD to J7 cab ground. The left lower headlight is grounded through
            circuits 52-GE, 66J, DRL day relay (150), and circuit 66-G to ground adapter (453).
