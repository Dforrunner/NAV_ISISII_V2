        <para>Power is fed from the batteries to junction block (J1), circuit 14D, fuse F21, and a black wire to the
            work light switch (199). When the switch is move to the on position, power will flow through the switch
            indicator lamp, and a white wire to cab ground causing it to illuminate.
        </para>
        <para>For trucks with the standard work light, when the work light switch is in the on position, power flows
            through a black wire and connector (127) to the orange work light pigtail causing the work light to
            illuminate. The ground path is through the white light pigtail, connector (127), and a white wire to rear
            cab ground.
        </para>
        <para>For trucks with the optional single Truck-light work light, when the work light switch is in the on
            position, power flows through both a yellow and green wire, a black wire to the work light pigtail, causing
            the work light to illuminate. The ground path is through the white light pigtail, and a white wire to the
            rear cab ground.
        </para>
        <para>For trucks with the optional dual Truck-light work lights, when the work light switch is in the on
            position, power flows through both a yellow and green wire, a black wire to the black work light pigtails,
            causing the work lights to illuminate. The ground path is through the white light pigtails, and a white wire
            to the rear cab ground.
