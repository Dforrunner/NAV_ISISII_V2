        <title>Headlight System Without DRL, With Signal-Stat 910 Turn Signal Switch, Floor-Mounted Dimmer Switch, and
            Without International Engine
        </title>
        <para>Power is supplied to (J1) junction block, circuit 14F, fuse F26, and circuit 50 to the headlight switch
            (35). When the headlight switch (35) is moved to the headlight on position, power flows through circuit 51,
            connector (1), circuit 51F, connector (17), and the green wire of the floor-mounted dimmer switch.
        </para>
        <para>When the dimmer switch is in the low/dim position, power flows through the switch, the blue wire,
            connector (17), circuits 53B, 53, connector (2), and circuit 53 to a splice.
        </para>
        <para>From the splice, power flows through circuit 53B to the left headlight (502) low beam element. The ground
            path is through circuits 11-GC, 11-GB, connector (2), and circuit 11-GB to cab ground. This causes the
            headlight dim element to illuminate.
        </para>
        <para>From the splice, power also flows through circuit 53A to the right headlight (504) low beam element. The
            ground path is through circuits 11-GE, 11-GB, connector (2), and circuit 11-GB to cab ground. This causes
            the headlight dim element to illuminate.
        </para>
        <para>When the floor-mounted dimmer switch is depressed to switch to high beam position, power flows through the
            dimmer switch, the brown wire, connector (17), circuits 52F, 52, connector (2) and circuit 52 to a splice.
        </para>
        <para>From the splice, power flows through circuit 52C to the left headlight (502) high beam element. The ground
            path is through circuits 11-GC, 11-GB, connector (2), and circuit 11-GB to cab ground. This causes the
            headlight bright element to illuminate.
        </para>
        <para>From the splice, power also flows through circuit 52B to the right headlight (504) high beam element. The
            ground path is through circuits 11-GE, 11-GB, connector (2), and circuit 11-GB to cab ground. This causes
            the headlight bright element to illuminate.
