            <para>All 3176B/3406E equipped vehicles have a Yellow "Engine Warning" light located in the instrument
                cluster. This light communicates engine status.
            </para>
            <para>During normal vehicle startup, turning the key to the ON position causes the Engine Warning Light to
                come ON as a system test. The light remains ON for about six seconds, then goes OFF. If the Engine
                Warning Light stays ON after the initial startup, the ECM has detected a problem with the system.
            </para>
            <para>If during vehicle operation, the Engine Warning Light comes ON, that indicates an active fault is
                present. The light will remain ON, but blink approximately every five seconds for a brief 1/2 second.
