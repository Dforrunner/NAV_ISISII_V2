        <title>PERFORMING A DIAGNOSTIC CHECK WITH THE ENGINE OFF</title>
        <para>A diagnostic check may be performed using the Diagnostic On/Off switch and Idle/ Diagnostic Inc/Dec
            switch. Any error codes will be flashed through the red Engine Stop light and yellow Engine Warning light.
            If no errors are found, both lights will stay on while the diagnostics switch is on. Consult the Cummins
            Operation and Maintenance Manual furnished with the vehicle for exact procedures and fault code information.
        </para>
        <para>To determine the fault codes use the following procedure:</para>

            <para count="1">Begin the procedure with the engine off.</para>
