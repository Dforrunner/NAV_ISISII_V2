            <title>Engine Warning Light</title>
            <para>The Engine Warning Light (Caterpillar Check Engine/Diagnostic Light) is located on the instrument
                panel and performs three functions.
            </para>
            <step1>
                <para count="1">The Engine Warning Light alerts the driver when the engine control system requires
                    service. The light comes ON and blinks (1/2 second) every five seconds whenever an ACTIVE fault code
                    is present.
                </para>
            </step1>
            <step1>
                <para count="1">The Engine Warning Light is turned ON as part of a system test each time the vehicle is
                    started. When the key is turned to the IGN position, the Engine Warning Light comes ON for
                    approximately 6 seconds and goes out after the engine is started.
                </para>
                <para>If the Engine Warning Light comes ON and stays ON after initial engine start-up, the ECM has
                    detected a problem.

            <step1>
                <para count="1">The Engine Warning Light can be used to flash diagnostic codes so that the codes can be
                    read without using an electronic service tool. Refer to

            <title>Data Link Connector</title>
            <para>The Data Link 8-pin connector (219) provides an electrical connection allowing communication between
                the ECM and Caterpillar and MPSI electronic service tools. Data Link connector (219) is located on the
                left kick panel. Four of the eight Data Link connector terminals have circuits assigned. Those
                terminal/circuits are as follows:
            </para>
            <step1>
                <para count="1">Terminal #1 is the positive (+) data link connection to the ECM through OEM connector
                    (263) terminal #32.
                </para>
            </step1>
            <step1>
                <para count="1">Terminal #2 is the negative (-) data link connection to the ECM through OEM connector
                    (263) terminal #21. The positive and negative data link circuits are a twisted pair of wires.
                </para>
            </step1>
            <step1>
                <para count="1">Terminal #3 has ignition voltage when the key is ON. The ignition voltage (12V) powers
                    electronic service tools when connected to the Data Link. Data Link connector (263) terminal #3
                    receives power (circuit 97DL) from the RUN RELAY N.O. terminal, through 10A fuse P2 and 5A fuse P3.
                </para>
            </step1>
            <step1>
                <para count="1">Terminal #5 is grounded by circuit 11-GL/97-GA/97-GB through OEM connector (263)
                    terminal #2.
                </para>

        <svcsubproc>
            <title>"Engine Warning" Light</title>
            <para>The voltage source for the "Engine Warning" Light is J2 Ignition Feed Stud. The ground side of the
                light is circuit 97AT through the cab and engine harness, through OEM connector (263) terminal #29 to an
                ECM ground switch. The ECM ground switch "opens and closes" causing the "Engine Warning" Light to turn
                ON or OFF in response to ECM programming instructions.
