        <title>Heater Bunk W/PRO SLEEPER W/Standard Temperature Control</title>
        <para>When the ignition switch is ON, power flows in through circuit 12E and out through 12-GE and 11-GBE to
            energize aux bunk relay (147). Thus when the bunk blower switch is moved to the low speed position, power
            flows from B2 battery stud, through circuit 14AK, 14AU, fuse F10-A, circuit 75W, relay (147) contacts,
            circuit 75X, 75AG, bunk blower switch, circuit 75AD, and the full resistor network and thermo fuse assembly
            to sleeper blower motor. The ground circuit for the blower motor is circuit 75-GAE, 11-GAG, 11-GBC, 11-GBD
            and 11-GBE to ground adapter (454).
        </para>
        <para>When the bunk blower switch is moved to the medium position, power flows as described above to the bunk
            blower switch, then through circuit 75AC, then through half of the sleeper blower resistor network and the
            thermo fuse, and blower circuits previously described.
        </para>
        <para>When the bunk blower switch is moved to the high position, power flows as described above to the bunk
            blower switch. Then power flows through circuit 75AF to energize high speed blower relay (584) and flows
            through ground circuit 75-GR. This allows power to flow from aux bunk blower relay through circuits 75X and
            75AA to high speed blower relay (584). Power then flows through relay (584) contacts, circuit 75AB, then
            without going through any of the sleeper blower resistor network, it flows through the thermo fuse to the
            sleeper blower motor.
        </para>
        <para>A motorized damper door is located between the sleeper and the heater/air conditioner box located in the
            cab under the passenger's seat. Power is fed to this motorized damper on circuit 75AP, and the ground path
            in circuit 75-GK, 11-GAF, 11-GBC, 11-GBD, and 11-GBE to ground adapter (454).
        </para>
        <para>The control circuitry for the damper consists of the following: power flows through circuit 75AH, through
            winter/summer switch, circuit 75AM, temperature control, circuit 75AN, and circuit 75-GS to ground circuit
            for damper control. Thus a variable voltage is available from the temperature control on circuit 75AL to
            regulate the damper by its motor.
        </para>
        <para>By moving the winter/summer switch to its other position, the relationship of open/cool and closed/warm is
            switched to open/warm and closed/cool.
        </para>
        <specpara>
            <note>
                <para>This is the standard manual temperature control so the output of the system does not change with
                    temperature, just the initial setting.
