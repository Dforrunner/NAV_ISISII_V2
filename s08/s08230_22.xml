        <para>When the ignition switch (24) is moved to the ignition or accessories position, power flows through
            circuit 12, circuit 12B, fuse F19, circuit 78, connector (90), circuit 83A, relay (136) and ground path 83-G
            to energize the power window relay (136). With relay (136) energized, power is available to flow from (J1)
            junction block through circuit 14P, circuit 14C, fuse F13, circuit 83, relay (136), circuit 83C, and
            connector (222) to left power window switch, driver's side. Power is also available to flow from relay (136)
            through circuits 83C and 83E to right power window switch, driver's side. Circuit 83D provides power to
            right power window switch, passenger's side, from relay (136).
        </para>
        <para>When the left power window switch, driver's side, is moved to the down position, power flows from the
            switch through circuit 83H, connector (141), circuit 83H, and connector (132) to the left window motor,
            causing the window to lower. The ground path is through connector (132), circuit 83F, connector (141),
            circuit 83F, the left power window switch, driver's side, and circuit 83-GA to cab ground.
        </para>
        <para>When the left power window switch is moved to the up position, power flows from the switch through circuit
            83F, connector (141), circuit 83F, and connector (132) to the left window motor causing the window to raise.
            The ground path is through connector (132), circuit 83H, connector (141), circuit 83H, the left power window
            switch, driver's side, circuit 83-GA to cab ground.
