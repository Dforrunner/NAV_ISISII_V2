        <para>Refer to Accessory Power in POWER DISTRIBUTION &#38; GROUND SYSTEM for description of accessory power
            circuits to A3 Accessory Adapter (501). Refer to HEATED MIRRORS AND RIGHT MOTORIZED MIRROR circuit diagram
            in CTS-5119S for the following discussion.

        <para>
            <emph type="bold">Heated Mirror -</emph>The heated mirror switch (438) receives power from A3 Accessory
            Adapter (501) through 10A fuse F5-A with the key in the or position. With the switch ON, power is applied to
            the heater element in the mirrors. Note that the mirror switch includes two LEDs.
        </para>
        <para>The LED that receives power from terminal 6 with the mirror switch ON is illuminated to indicate that the
            mirror heaters are ON. The LED between terminals 7 and 8 is used to illuminate the switch.
        </para>
        <para>
            <emph type="bold">Right Motorized Mirror -</emph>The right motorized mirror switch (437) receives power from
            A3 Accessory Adapter (501) through 10A fuse F5-A with the key in the or position. Momentarily positioning
            the switch down from the neutral position closes the circuit between switch contacts 1 - 2 and 4 - 5. This
            applies voltage to the motor on circuit 78F and grounds the motor through 78E.
        </para>
        <para>Momentarily positioning the switch up from the neutral position closes the circuit between switch contacts
            2-3 and 5-6. This applies voltage to the motor on circuit 78E and grounds the motor through 78F.
