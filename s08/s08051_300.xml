            <para>When the ignition switch is ON, power flows in through circuit 13J and out through 13-GT to energize
                heater control relay (463-R5). Thus when the heater control is set to low, medium or high, power is
                available to flow through circuit 77, fuse F1-B, and circuit 77H where it can split at connector (46).
                From (46) it can flow through circuit 77C to feed the low pressure safety switch, circuit 77C and 77E to
                feed the high pressure safety switch, and 77B to feed the manual temperature control. If the refrigerant
                pressure is greater than the low pressure cut off switch, and less than the high pressure cut off
                switch, circuits 77J and 77F remain de-energized. Thus A/C relay normally closed (N/C) contacts remain
                closed and if the manual temperature control contacts close, power will flow from the temperature
                control through circuits 77A, A/C relay contacts, and circuit 77C to energize the freon compressor
                clutch. When the evaporator temperature cools to below 28 to 32 degrees, the manual temperature control
                contacts will open cutting off the flow of power to the compressor clutch. This will keep the evaporator
                from freezing over. The contacts will also open up if a temperature cooler than what is selected at the
                dash is achieved. If either of the safety pressure switches close, the A/C relay will energize and its
                contacts will open up breaking power to the compressor clutch.
