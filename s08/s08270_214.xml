        <title>Daytime Running Lights (DRL) - Canada</title>
        <para>Power from the A3 accessories adapter (593) is applied to circuit 12R, 10A fuse F10-A, and circuit 66A to
            DRL day relay (475) N.O. contacts. Circuit 66B applies this power also to the relay coil. When the park
            brake is released, the contacts of the park brake switch (293) close. If the headlight switch is in the off
            position, a ground path is applied to the DRL day relay (475), causing it to become energized. The ground
            path is circuit 66D, the closed contacts of switch (293), circuit 66E, the N.C. contacts of relay (474),
            circuits 66-GC, 66-GB, and 66-GA to G6 ground adapter (616). With the DRL day relay (475) energized, the
            power that is applied to the relay's N.O. contacts will flow through the relay's contacts, circuit 66J,
            connector (490), circuit 11-GL, connector (423)/(498), and circuit 11-GL to the common side of the left
            headlight elements. Since the headlights are then connected in series, the voltage will be divided in half,
            causing the 6 volts at each high beam element to illuminate at approximately 50% of its brightness.
        </para>
        <para>The DRL night relay (474) is grounded through circuits 66-GB and 66-GA to G6 ground adapter (616). Thus
            when the headlight switch (410) is placed in the on position, power is applied to circuits 50B and 66H,
            connector (N/L), and circuit 66H to the DRL relay (474). This energizes the relay which opens up the ground
            circuit for the DRL day relay (475), and enables the ground to the fog light circuitry, thus de-energizing
            the relay and causing the headlights to be connected in parallel and to illuminate at normal low beam
            brightness.
