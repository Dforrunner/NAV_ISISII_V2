        <title>PYROMETER</title>
        <svcprocinfo>
            <para>The pyrometer measures engine exhaust gas temperature. The system includes a gauge in the left gauge
                cluster, a control module, located behind the center instrument panel, and a thermocouple in the exhaust
                pipe near the turbocharger.
            </para>
        </svcprocinfo>
        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Exhaust Thermocouple</title>
            <para>The exhaust thermocouple generates a very small voltage when heated by the exhaust gas. The voltage
                goes up as the exhaust temperature goes up. The voltage is too small to drive a gauge so the
                thermocouple lead is connected to an amplifier. The thermocouple and leads are special wire, so if
                damaged, the thermocouple/lead assembly must be replaced as one assembly.
            </para>

        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Pyrometer Control Module (Amplifier)</title>
            <para>The pyrometer control module receives 12V ignition voltage at connector (15) from ignition adapter
                (494) on circuit 25. This circuit is protected by 10A fuse F10-A. The control module ground is through
                connector (15) circuit 25-G to ground adapter (454).
            </para>
            <para>The thermocouple signal is input through connector (492) on the red and yellow leads. This signal is
                processed and amplified and a variable signal representing exhaust temperature is sent on the brown wire
                through connector (15) on circuit 25B, to the gauge cluster connector (423) to gauge pin D. The module
                also applies a constant reference voltage (8.2V &#177; 0.5V) from the blue wire through connector (15)
                on circuit 25A to the left gauge cluster connector (423) to gauge pin A.
            </para>
        </svcsubproc>
        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Pyrometer Gauge</title>
            <para>The gauge cluster contains a printed circuit board that the 3-pin pyrometer gauge plugs into. This
                gauge is an electromagnetic type that is actuated by reference voltage from the control module at pin A.
            </para>
            <para>Gauge pin D receives the signal voltage representing exhaust temperature from the module, causing the
                gauge pointer to deflect appropriately. With a cold engine, the signal voltage is too small to measure.
                With the engine running and exhaust gas at about 600&#176;F, the signal to the gauge is about 1.6 volts.
                With exhaust gas at about 1200&#176;F, the signal to the gauge is about 4.5 volts.
