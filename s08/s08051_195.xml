        <title>PARK/TURN/SIDE MARKER LIGHTS 9300 W/DRL</title>
        <para>When the headlight switch is in the park or position, and the cab and trailer lights switch is ON, the cab
            and trailer lights relay is energized and power flows on circuits 68E and 68D through fuse F8-C to circuits
            68C and 58H. Then the current is split through circuit 58T to the left park/turn/marker light low element
            and circuit 58U to the right park/turn/marker light low element. The ground circuits for the left light are
            56-G and 52-GA to J7 cab ground. The ground circuits for the right marker are 57-G and 52-GD to J7 cab
            ground.
        </para>
        <para>The turn signal switch provides power on circuit 56D to the left side turn light and circuit 56 to the
            left/park/turn/marker light high element.
        </para>
        <para>The turn signal switch provides power on circuit 57D to the right side turn light and circuit 57 to the
            right/park/turn/marker light high element.
        </para>
        <para>The ground path for the park/turn/marker lights was mentioned above. The ground path for the left side
            turn light is circuit 56-GA and 11-GD to ground stud at left dash panel. The ground path for the right side
            turn light is circuit 57-GA, and 11-GB to ground stud at right dash panel.
