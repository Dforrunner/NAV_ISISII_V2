        <title>Fog Light System, With Canadian DRL, With International Engine</title>
        <para>When the headlights are on and low beams are selected, power is fed to circuit 64A from the low beam
            headlight circuit. When the fog light switch (98) is moved to the on position, power flows through circuit
            64A, connector (91), circuit 64A, and the indicator in the fog light switch (98). The ground path is
            circuits 64-GA, 66-GB, inline connector, and circuit 66-GB to relay bracket ground stud. This causes the
            switch indicator to illuminate.
        </para>
        <para>Power also flows from the on fog light switch and through circuit 64B to the fog light relay (99). Power
            then energizes the relay by flowing through its coil and ground circuit 66-GB, inline connector, and circuit
            66-GB to ground.
        </para>
        <para>With the relay energized, power flows from junction block (J1) through circuit 14F, fuse F25, circuit 64,
            energized relay (99), circuit 64C, connector (2), circuit 64C, connector (425), circuit 64C, connector (501)
            and circuit 64C to a splice. From the splice, power flows through circuit 64D and connector (506) to the
            left fog light yellow pigtail.
        </para>
        <para>This causes the left fog light to illuminate. The ground path for the left fog light is through the white
            pigtail, connector (506), circuits 64-GC, 64-GB, connector (501), circuits 64-GB, 11-GB, connector (425),
            circuit 11-GB and 11-GJ to starter ground.
        </para>
        <para>From the splice, power also flows through circuit 64E and connector (507) to the right fog light yellow
            pigtail. This causes the right fog light to illuminate. The ground path for the right fog light is through
            the white pigtail, connector (507), circuits 64-GD, 64-GB, connector (501), circuits 64-GB, 11-GB, connector
            (425), circuit 11-GB and 11-GJ to starter ground.
