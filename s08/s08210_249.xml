            <para>The troubleshooting guide requires checking specific connectors. Use the following steps to determine
                if the connector is causing the problem. If a defective condition is found, make the necessary
                corrections and continue the process.

                    Make sure the connector is capable of properly locking the connector together.

                    terminal/wire assembly should easily withstand 10 pounds of pull and remain in the connector. This
                    test determines (A) if the wire is properly in the terminal and (B) if the terminal is properly
                    inserted into the connector. Correct any defects noted.

                    This is especially important with an intermittent symptom. Using a new pin, insert the pin into each

                    mating side of the connector, using a new female terminal for the test.

            <title>Performing Electrical Tests at CEC Module Connector (379)</title>
            <para>CEC module connector (379) mates with the black ECM connector. This is a 60-pin connector, with the
                International side having female terminals (sockets) and the ECM side having pins.

            <title>Replacing International Components</title>
            <para>When replacing electrical switches, connectors (including pins and sockets), relays or other
                components, use only approved International replacement parts. Many of the switches have gold or silver
                plated contacts and some of the connectors have gold plated terminals. By using correct replacement
                parts, you maintain the design integrity of the system.
            </para>
            <para>All of the relays and other solenoids installed by International are suppressed to prevent voltage
                spikes from damaging electrical components. Again, use only International replacements for these
                components.
