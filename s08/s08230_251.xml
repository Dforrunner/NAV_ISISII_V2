        <title>Headlight System With USA DRL, With Int'l Turn Signal Switch, Turn Signal Lever-Mounted Dimmer Switch,
            Air Brakes And Without International Engine
        </title>
        <para>Power is supplied to (J1) junction block, circuit 14F, fuse F26, circuit 50 and circuit 50B to the
            headlight switch (35).
        </para>
        <para>When the headlight switch (35) is moved to the headlight on or park positions and the turn signal lever
            dimmer switch is in the dim position, power from J1 flows through circuit 14E, fuse 24, circuit 50A,
            headlight switch (35) (in terminal 5, out terminal 4), circuit 51C, energizes the coil of the lift-to-dim
            headlight relay (274), circuit 51D, connector (458), the dimmer switch, connector (458), circuit 51-G and
            11-G to cab ground.
        </para>
        <para>This energizes the lift-to-dim headlight relay and allows power to flow from the headlight switch (35)
            through circuit 51A, the N.O. contacts of relay (274), circuits 53A, 53, connector (2), and circuit 53 to a
            splice.
        </para>
        <para>From the splice, power flows through circuit 53B to the left headlight (502) low beam element. The ground
            path is through circuits 11-GC, 11-GB, connector (2), and circuit 11-GB to cab ground. This causes the
            headlight dim element to illuminate.
        </para>
        <para>From the splice, power also flows through circuit 53A to the right headlight (504) low beam element. The
            ground path is through circuits 11-GE, 11-GB, connector (2), and circuit 11-GB to cab ground. This causes
            the headlight dim element to illuminate.
        </para>
        <para>When the turn signal switch lever is pushed forward to the high beam/bright position, power is interrupted
            to the lift-to-dim relay (274) coil causing it to de-energize. With the relay de-energized and the headlight
            switch in the headlight on position, power flows from relay (274), circuits 52C, 52, connector (2), and
            circuit 52 to a splice.
        </para>
        <para>From the splice, power flows through circuit 52C to the left headlight (502) high beam element. The ground
            path is through circuits 11-GC, 11-GB, connector (2), and circuit 11-GB to cab ground. This causes the
            headlight bright element to illuminate.
        </para>
        <para>From the splice, power also flows through circuit 52B to the right headlight (504) high beam element. The
            ground path is through circuits 11-GE, 11-GB, connector (2), and circuit 11-GB to cab ground. This causes
            the headlight bright element to illuminate.
        </para>
        <para>When the turn signal lever controlled dimmer switch is moved forward and held, power flows from fuse F26
            through circuits 50, 50D, 50C, the coil of flash-to-pass relay (273), circuit 51E, connector (458), the
            dimmer switch, connector (458), circuit 51-G, and 11-G to cab ground. This energizes the flash-to-pass relay
            (273), and allows power to flow from fuse F26 through circuits 50, 50D, N.O. contacts of relay (273),
            circuits 52E, 52, connector (2), and circuit 52 to a splice.
        </para>
        <para>From the splice power flows through circuit 52C to the left headlight (502) high beam element, and circuit
            52B to the right headlight (504) high beam element, causing the high beam elements to illuminate, thus
            signaling the driver's intent to pass. The ground paths are as previously described.
        </para>
        <para>Power is supplied to USA DRL module (165) from (J1) junction block, through circuit 14L, fuse F31 and
            circuit 66A. The module is provided a ground path through circuit 66-GA to cab ground.
        </para>
        <para>When high beam/bright headlights are turned on, a signal is sent to the USA DRL module (165) through
            circuit 66E, connector (178) and circuit 66E. Thus, the module which supplies power to the fog light circuit
            64A can switch off the fog lights when the high beam/bright headlights are selected.
        </para>
        <para>The USA DRL module (165) is enabled via circuit 66 when the key switch (24) is moved to the ignition or
            accessories position. When the air parking brake (218) is released, its contacts open up and remove the
            ground signal to circuit 66K and 66J to the USA DRL module (165).
        </para>
        <para>The module will then apply power to circuit 66C, connector (178), circuits 66C, 53, connector (2), circuit
            53, and circuits 53B and 53A to the left and right low beam elements, respectively. The module will power
            the lights at about 60% of full power. When the headlight switch is moved to headlight on position, the
            power from the headlight switch will override the module and power the lamps at 100%.
