        <title>Front Park, Turn and Marker, and Side Turn and Marker Lights - 9800 SBA</title>
        <para>The front park lights receive power through the trailer tail light relay (464-R9), circuits 68E and 68B,
            fuse F8-C, circuits 68C and 54, and connector (N/L). From connector (N/L), power flows through circuit 54,
            connector (N/L), and circuit 54 to a splice.
        </para>
        <para>From the splice, power flows through a brown wire, the left front park light connector (242), and a brown
            wire to the park light. Power also flows from the splice, through a brown wire, the left side marker light
            connector (241), and a black wire to the marker light. The left front park light is grounded through a dark
            blue wire, connector (242), and a blue wire to a splice. The left side marker light is grounded through a
            white wire, connector (241), and a blue wire to a splice. From the splice, a ground is provided through
            circuit 11-GL, connector (498)/(423), circuit 11-GL, connector (490), and circuits 11-GM and 11-GF to left
            cab ground (429) without Canadian daytime running lights. With Canadian DRL, the left front park light is
            grounded through a dark blue wire, connector (242), a blue wire, a splice, circuit 11-GAG, connector (580),
            and circuit 11-GAG to G6 ground adapter (616). As previously stated, the front park lights receive power
            through the trailer tail light relay (464-R9), circuits 68E and 68B, fuse F8-C, circuits 68C and 54, and
            connector (N/L). From connector (N/L), power flows through circuit 54A, connector (N/L), and circuit 54A to
            a splice.
        </para>
        <para>From the splice, power flows through a brown wire, the right front park light connector (242), and a brown
            wire to the marker light. Power also flows from the splice, through a brown wire, the right side marker
            light connector (241), and a black wire to the marker light. The right front park light is grounded through
            a dark blue wire, connector (242), and a blue wire to a splice. The right side marker light is grounded
            through a white wire, connector (241), and a blue wire to a splice. From the splice, a ground is provided
            through circuit 11-GK, connector (498)/(400), circuits 11-GK and 11-G to right cab ground (404).
        </para>
        <para>The turn signal switch, when in left turn position, provides power to circuit 56E, connector (N/L), and
            circuit 56E to a splice. From the splice, power flows through a red wire, the left front turn light
            connector (242), and a red wire to the left turn light. Power also flows from the splice, through a red
            wire, the left side turn light connector (241), and a red wire to the left side turn light. The left front
            turn light is grounded through a dark blue wire, connector (242), and a blue wire, to a splice. The left
            side turn light is grounded through a white wire, connector (241), and a blue wire to a splice. From the
            splice, the lights on vehicles with Canadian DRL are grounded through circuit 11-GAG, connector (580), and
            circuit 11-GAG to G6 ground adapter (616). From the splice, the lights on vehicles without Canadian DRL are
            grounded through circuit 11-GL, connector (498)/(423), circuit 11-GL, connector (490), and circuits 11-GM
            and 11-GF to left cab ground (429).
        </para>
        <para>The turn signal switch, when in right turn position, provides power to circuit 57E, connector (N/L), and
            circuit 57E to a splice. From the splice, power flows through a red wire, the right front turn light
            connector (242), and a red wire to the right turn light. Power also flows from the splice, through a red
            wire, the right side turn light connector (241), and a red wire to the right side turn light. The right
            front turn light is grounded through a dark blue wire, connector (242), and a blue wire to a splice. The
            right side turn light is grounded through a white wire, connector (241), and a blue wire to a splice. From
            the splice, the lights are grounded through circuit 11-GK, connector (498)/(400), circuits 11-GK and 11-G,
            and right cab ground.
        </para>
        <para>When the headlight switch is in the park lights position, the trailer tail light relay is energized, and
            power flows through 15A fuse F8-C, circuits 68C and 54, and connector (N/L). From connector (N/L), power
            flows through circuit 54, connector (N/L), and circuit 54 to a splice. From the splice power flows through a
            brown wire, connector (242), and a brown wire to the left front marker light. From the splice power also
            flows through a brown wire, connector (241), and a black wire to the left side marker light. From connector
            (N/L), power also flows through circuit 54A, connector (N/L), and circuit 54A to a splice. From the splice
            power flows through a brown wire, connector (242), and a brown wire to the right front marker light. From
            the splice power also flows through a brown wire, connector (241), and a black wire to the right side marker
            light. Refer to the turn light grounding above for a description of the marker light ground circuits.
