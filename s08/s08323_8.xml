            <para>International vehicle electrical systems are becoming increasingly complex with the addition of a BC,
                electronic engine and transmission controls, electronically driven instrument gauges, and Antilock Brake
                Systems (ABS) to name a few. While most systems still operate on battery voltage (12 volts), some
                systems operate at as high as 107 volts (electronic fuel injection) and as low as five (5) volts
                (electronic engine controls).
            </para>
            <para>International publishes Electrical Circuit Diagram Manuals for all its models. Body builders and
                installers should refer to these manuals before connecting body lights and accessories to the vehicle
                electrical system to assure that circuits chosen are both appropriate and not overloaded. Modifications
                not defined in the circuit diagram book are
                <emph type="bold">not</emph>
                to be made to the vehicle electrical/electronic control systems without first contacting International
                for assistance at its Tech Central Department, telephone 1-800-336-4500.
