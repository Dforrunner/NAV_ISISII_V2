        <title>UPGRADING THE ALTERNATOR</title>
        <para>Discharge currents greater than 20 amps usually require a larger alternator to solve the problem. Keep in
            mind that the Series 25, 250 amp alternator only outperforms the 190 or 200 at alternator speeds above 3000
            RPM. Increasing the pulley ratio is necessary if it is not correct.
        </para>
        <para>Hehr Power Systems recommends the maximum load on an alternator should not exceed 80% of its 200&#176;F
            (93&#176;C) rating (reference the power curves in Section 8.0.) at the speed of use. This allows a 20%
            margin of error to account for higher temperature, low voltage, belt wear, etc.
        </para>
        <para>Replacing a smaller alternator with the 250 amp model will require a battery cable upgrade and possibly an
            isolator upgrade (if equipped).
        </para>
        <para>If you find a serious overload, the alternator upgrade may be the best solution. Anything less may result
            in a burned up alternator (due to the heat caused by a constant full field condition) or the destruction of
            expensive equipment.
