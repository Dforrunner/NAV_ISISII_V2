        <title>Headlight System With USA DRL, With Signal-Stat 915 Turn Signal Switch, Push Button Dimmer Switch, Air
            Brakes and Without International Engine
        </title>
        <para>Power is supplied to (J1) junction block, circuit 14F, fuse F26, and circuit 50 to the headlight switch
            (35). When the headlight switch (35) is moved to the headlight on position and the push button dimmer is in
            the dim position, power flows through circuit 51, connector (1DRL), circuit 51F, connector (17), circuit
            51B, dimmer relay (276) N.C. contacts, circuit 53D, connector (17), circuits 53B, 53, connector (2), and
            circuit 53 to a splice.
        </para>
        <para>From the splice, power flows through circuit 53B to the left headlight (502) low beam element. The ground
            path is through circuits 11-GC, 11-GB, connector (2), and circuit 11-GB to cab ground. This causes the
            headlight dim element to illuminate.
        </para>
        <para>From the splice, power also flows through circuit 53A to the right headlight (504) low beam element. The
            ground path is through circuits 11-GE, 11-GB, connector (2), and circuit 11-GB to cab ground. This causes
            the headlight dim element to illuminate.
        </para>
        <para>When the headlight switch is in the headlight on position, and the push button dimmer is moved to the
            bright position, power flows from (J1) junction block through circuit 14A, fuse F7, circuits 63, 50E, dimmer
            relay (276) coil, circuit 51-GA, connector (421), a white wire, dimmer switch, a white wire, connector
            (421), circuit 52-GA, and 11-G to cab ground.
        </para>
        <para>This energizes dimmer relay (276) and allows power to flow through the N.O. contacts, circuit 52D,
            connector (17), circuits 52F, 52, connector (2), and circuit 52 to a splice.
        </para>
        <para>From the splice, power flows through circuit 52C to the left headlight (502) high beam element. The ground
            path is through circuits 11-GC, 11-GB, connector (2), and circuit 11-GB to cab ground. This causes the
            headlight bright element to illuminate.
        </para>
        <para>From the splice, power also flows through circuit 52B to the right headlight (504) high beam element. The
            ground path is through circuits 11-GE, 11-GB, connector (2), and circuit 11-GB to cab ground. This causes
            the headlight bright element to illuminate.
        </para>
        <para>Power is also applied to (J1) junction block, circuit 14L, fuse F31, circuit 66A to USA DRL module (165).
            the ground path for the module is circuit 66-GA.
        </para>
        <para>The module receives input from the high beam headlight circuit over circuit 66E, connector (178), and
            circuit 66E. This input is used to tell the module to shut down the fog light power feed circuit 64A when
            the high beam headlights are selected.
        </para>
        <para>A 12 volt signal is also fed to the module from the key switch (24) on circuit 66 when the ignition switch
            is turned on. Thus, when this signal is present and the parking brake is released, the DRL module will feed
            the headlight low beam elements at about 60% of full power on circuit 66C, connector (178), circuits 66C,
            53, connector (2), and circuit 53 to a splice. From the splice, power flows through circuit 53B to the left
            headlight (502) and circuit 53A to the right headlight (504). If the headlights are already turned on, the
            main power feed will override the 60% power to 100%. The parking brake On/Off condition is fed to the DRL
            module by applying a ground to the module through circuits 66J, 66K, N.C. air pressure switch (168), and
            circuit 66-G to cab ground.
