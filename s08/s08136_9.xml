        <title>ENGINE BRAKE</title>
        <svcprocinfo>
            <para>A Series 60, DDEC controlled vehicle with an engine brake operates the same as a mechanically
                controlled vehicle with an engine brake (see Operators Manual for operating instructions). With DDEC,
                the driver controls the engine brake switches, but the system is enabled (or disabled) by the Engine
                Brake Enable Relay (363) which is controlled by the ECM. The DDEC system utilizes an "enable" relay for
                the engine brake system, rather than an engine brake control module. An Engine Brake ON/OFF switch (359)
                and Engine Brake Selector switch (360) are also part of the control system.

            <title>Engine Brake On/Off Switch (359)</title>
            <para>The ON/OFF switch is a two-pole, single-throw switch. The switch receives ignition voltage from two
                sources.
            </para>
            <para>Ignition power to energize the Engine Brake Enable Relay comes from fuse F2 and through the closed
                contacts of the clutch switch (clutch pedal released) on circuit 24AK.
            </para>
            <para>Ignition power to the other pole of the ON/OFF switch comes directly from fuse F2 (circuit 24AC) and
                is used to energize the engine brake solenoids. A vehicle with an Antilock Brake System (ABS) receives
                ignition power to energize the engine brake solenoids from the ABS Engine Brake Relay (part of ABS
                system) on circuit 24AH/24AL. This is done so that the ABS can disable the engine brake if it senses a
                wheel skid is possible. Refer to GROUP 04 - BRAKES in the CTS-5000 Master Service Manual for circuit
                diagrams and troubleshooting information on ABS.

            <title>Engine Brake Enable Relay (363)</title>
            <para>The engine brake enable relay control coil receives ignition power from 10 amp fuse F2 through the
                clutch switch (pedal released) and the engine brake ON/OFF switch (ON position). The control coil for
                the relay is grounded through a diode to ECM terminal (A1). The ECM energizes the Enable relay (363) by
                controlling the ground circuit at ECM terminal A1.
            </para>
            <para>The ECM enables or disables the ground by switching between 0 volts or 12 volts at terminal A1 in
                response to programmed instructions and inputs from other sensors and switches. ECM terminal A1 will be
                at ground, enabling the relay whenever there is no demand for fuel (throttle in idle position) and
                engine speed is at least 150 rpm higher than the idle setting. Cruise control must also be disabled.
            </para>
            <para>With the Engine Brake Enable Relay (363) energized, ignition power from fuse F2 through the ON/OFF
                switch is delivered through the relay (common contact 30 and NO contact 87) and the Engine Brake
                Selector Switch (360) to energize the engine brake solenoids.
            </para>
        </svcsubproc>
        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Engine Brake Selector Switch (360)</title>
            <para>The selector switch receives ignition voltage from the enable relay on circuit 24AD when the enable
                relay is energized. The ignition power is delivered from the selector switch through the International
                installed cab, engine harness and DDEC engine brake harness (at connector 373) to the engine brake
                solenoids (engine brake solenoids are installed by Detroit Diesel).
            </para>
            <para>Note that the selector switch in the circuit diagram is in the FULL engine brake position. Ignition
                power is sent through connector 373 to DDEC circuits 621 (front solenoid) and 622 (rear solenoids).
            </para>
            <para>Placing the selector switch in the "center" position, as viewed in the circuit diagram, applies power
                to DDEC circuit 622 (rear solenoid only).
            </para>
            <para>With the selector switch in "left" position as viewed in the circuit diagram, power is applied to DDEC
                circuit 621 (front solenoid only).
