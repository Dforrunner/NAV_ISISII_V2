                    <para>The Engine Warning Light alerts the driver when the engine control system requires service.
                        The light comes ON and blinks every five seconds whenever an ACTIVE fault code is present.

                <item>
                    <para>The Engine Warning Light is turned ON as part of a system test each time the vehicle is
                        started. When the key is turned to the IGN position, the Engine Warning Light comes ON for
                        approximately 6 seconds and goes out after the engine is started.
                    </para>
                    <para>If the Engine Warning Light comes ON and stays ON after initial engine start up, the ECM has
                        detected a problem.

            <para>The Engine Warning light voltage source is J1 Ignition Connector. The Engine Warning light is grounded
                by circuit 97AT through the cab and engine harness, through OEM connector (191) terminal 29 by an ECM
                ground switch. The ECM applies 12V (LIGHT OFF) or 0 volts (LIGHT ON) to circuit 97AT in response to ECM
                programming and engine conditions.

            <para>The Data Link 8 pin connector (137) allows Electronic Service Tools (EST) to communicate with the ECM.
                Data Link connector (137) is located on left instrument panel. Four of the eight Data Link connector
                cavities have terminals. Those terminal/ circuits are as follows:
