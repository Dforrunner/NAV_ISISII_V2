                    <para>Before beginning these test procedures, make sure the vehicle batteries are at 75% state of
                        charge (SOC) or higher. This represents an open circuit voltage (OCV) of 12.4 volts. Batteries
                        with an OCV of 12 volts or less are either completely discharged or have a dead cell.

                    <para>Before beginning these test procedures, check any light or indicator lamp filaments that are
                        suspected of being open (burned out). This is done to avoid unnecessary extensive circuit
                        checks.

                    <para>Before beginning these test procedures, inspect all connectors for loose or damaged pins,
                        wires, etc. Refer to TEST EQUIPMENT AND CONNECTOR REPAIR section in GROUP 08 - ELECTRICAL in the
                        CTS-5000 Master Service Manual.

                    <para>When the technician determines that a fuse is blown, while checking its condition, he is
                        directed to locate the cause of the overload condition and to repair it. While no further
                        instruction on this procedure is listed in the diagnostic tables, the common procedure is as
                        follows: isolate sections of the circuit, by disconnecting connectors, and measure the
                        resistance to ground to find the circuit that is shorted to ground. Then locate the damaged spot
                        in the wire or connector and repair.

                    <para>Diagnostics for circuits that are malfunctioning by sticking in the on position are generally
                        not covered in detail. It is assumed that the technician knows to check for a malfunctioning
                        switch, relay, or solenoid.
