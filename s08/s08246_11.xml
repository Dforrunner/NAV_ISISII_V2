        <title>HYDRAULIC RETARDER</title>
        <para>The hydraulic retarder, which is attached to the rear of the transmission, is controlled by the WTEC III
            controller to slow the vehicle when the retarder request switch is in the on position, cruise control is on,
            and the ECM requests that the retarder come on to slow the vehicle. The retarder will also activate if the
            brake pedal is depressed. The retarder will not operate if the transmission output speed drops below 350
            rpm. Thus, the retarder slows the vehicle by providing a braking torque at the output of the transmission.
            The amount of retardation will be reduced if the engine coolant temperature climbs too high to prevent the
            engine from overheating.
