            <para>When the ignition switch is on, power flows in through circuits 13H and 13AK and out through 13-GT to
                energize heater control relay (463-R5). Thus, when the heater control is set to low, medium or high,
                power will flow through circuit 77 and energize the A/C control relay (144).
            </para>
            <para>Power from fuse F1-B will flow through the relay to circuit 77H where it can split at connector (162).
                From (162) it can flow through circuit 77C to feed the low pressure safety switch, circuits 77C and 77E
                to feed the high pressure safety switch, and 77B to feed the manual temperature control.
            </para>
            <para>If the refrigerant pressure is greater than the low pressure cut off switch and less than the high
                pressure cut off switch, circuits 77J and 77F remain de-energized. Thus, A/C relay (463-R6) normally
                closed (N.C.) contacts closed and if the manual temperature control contacts close, power will flow from
                the temperature control through circuit 77F, A/C relay (463-R) contacts, and circuit 77C to energize the
                refrigerant compressor clutch.
            </para>
            <para>When the evaporator temperature cools to below 30&#176; &#177; 2&#176; (-1&#176; &#177; 1&#176;C), the
                manual temperature control contacts will open cutting off the flow of power to the compressor clutch.
                This will keep the evaporator from freezing over. The contacts will also open up if a temperature cooler
                than what is selected at the dash is achieved. If either of the safety pressure switches close, the A/C
                relay will energize and its contacts will open up breaking power to the compressor clutch.
            </para>
            <para>With the air conditioning relay (463-R6) energized, power is interrupted to the refrigerant compressor
                clutch, and power is applied to circuit 77D going to the air conditioning relay coil. Thus the
                compressor is shut down and latched (locked) out by the air conditioning relay, and will not restart
                until the refrigerant pressure is back within operating range and the A/C on/off switch or the blower
                control switch is moved to the off position and then on.
