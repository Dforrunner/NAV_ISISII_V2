        <title>Headlight System With Canadian DRL, With Int'l Turn Signal Switch, Turn Signal Lever-Mounted Dimmer
            Switch, Hydraulic Brakes and Without International Engine
        </title>
        <para>Power is supplied to (J1) junction block, circuit 14F, fuse F26, circuit 50 and circuit 50B to the
            headlight switch (35). When the headlight switch (35) is moved to the headlight on position and the turn
            signal lever dimmer switch is in the dim position, power flows through circuit 51A, circuit 51C, lift-to-dim
            headlight relay (274) coil, circuit 51D, connector (458), the dimmer switch, connector (458), circuit 51-G
            and 11-G to cab ground. This energizes the lift-to-dim headlight relay and allows power to flow from the
            headlight switch (35) through circuit 51A, the N.O. contacts of relay (274), circuits 53A, 53, connector
            (2), and circuit 53 to a splice.
        </para>
        <para>From the splice, power flows through circuit 53B to the left headlight (502) low beam element. The ground
            path is through circuit 66C, connector (2), circuit 66C, DRL day relay (163) N.C. contacts, and circuit
            66-GA to cab ground. This causes the headlight dim element to illuminate.
        </para>
        <para>From the splice, power also flows through circuit 53A to the right headlight (504) low beam element. The
            ground path is through circuits 11-GE, 11-GB, connector (2), and circuit 11-GB to cab ground. This causes
            the headlight dim element to illuminate. The fog light feed is from the low beam circuit, via circuit 64A,
            connector (91), and circuit 64A to the fog light switch (98). Thus, the fog lights are inoperative without
            headlights or when the high beams are selected.
        </para>
        <para>When the turn signal switch lever is pushed forward to the bright position, power is interrupted to the
            lift-to-dim relay (274) coil causing it to de-energize. With the relay de-energized and the headlight switch
            in the headlight on position, power flows from relay (274), circuits 52C, 52, connector (2), and circuit 52
            to a splice.
        </para>
        <para>From the splice, power flows through circuit 52C to the left headlight (502) high beam element. The ground
            path is through circuit 66C, connector (2), circuit 66C, DRL day relay (163) N.C. contacts, and circuit
            66-GA to cab ground. This causes the headlight bright element to illuminate.
        </para>
        <para>From the splice, power also flows through circuit 52B to the right headlight (504) high beam element. The
            ground path is through circuits 11-GE, 11-GB, connector (2), and circuit 11-GB to cab ground. This causes
            the headlight bright element to illuminate.
        </para>
        <para>When the turn single lever controlled dimmer switch is moved forward and held, power flows from fuse F26
            through circuits 50, 50D, 50C, the coil of flash-to-pass relay (273), circuit 51E, connector (458), the
            dimmer switch, connector (458), circuit 51-G and 11-G to cab ground. This energizes the flash-to-pass relay
            (273), and allows power to flow from fuse F26 through circuits 50, 50D, N.O. contacts of relay (273),
            circuits 52E, 52, connector (2), and circuit 52 to a splice.
        </para>
        <para>From the splice power flows through circuit 52C to the left headlight (502) high beam element, and circuit
            52B to the right headlight (504) high beam element, causing the high beam elements to illuminate, thus,
            signaling the driver's intent to pass. The ground paths are as previously described.
        </para>
        <para>When the key switch (24) is in the ignition or accessories position and the parking brake is applied,
            power flows from the key switch through circuits 66, 66H, DRL park brake relay (164) coil, circuit 66J,
            connector (212), circuit 44B, connector (214M), a black wire, park brake switch (218), a white wire,
            connector (214M), circuit 44-GA, connector (214F), circuit 44-G, interrupt switch (32), circuits 58-G,
            58-GA, connector (202) and a white wire to cab ground. This energizes the DRL park brake relay (164), and
            turns off the Daytime Running Lights that would be on if the headlight switch was in the off position.
        </para>
        <para>When the headlight switch is in the off position and the parking brake is released, DRL park brake relay
            (164) control circuit described above opens up, de-energizing the DRL parking brake relay (164). Then power
            flows from the key switch (24) through circuit 66, DRL day relay (163) coil, circuit 66B, DRL night relay
            (162) N.C. contacts, circuit 66F, DRL park brake relay (164) N.C. contacts, and circuit 66-GD to cab ground.
            This energizes the DRL day relay (163).
        </para>
        <para>With DRL day relay (163) energized, power flows from (J1) junction block, through circuit 14L, fuse F31,
            circuit 66A, DRL day relay (163) N.O. contacts, circuit 66C, connector (2) and circuit 66C to the left
            headlight (502) high beam element, circuit 52C, and 52B to the right headlight (504) high beam element. The
            ground path is circuits 11-GE, 11-GB, connector (2), and circuit 11-GB to cab ground. This causes the
            headlight high beam/bright elements to be connected in series and thus illuminate at about 50% brightness.
        </para>
        <specpara>
            <note>
                <para>Circuit 52, connector (2), etc. is hooked in parallel with the feed circuit, and thus has some
                    effect on the current flow and lamp brightness.
                </para>
            </note>
        </specpara>
        <para>When the headlight switch is moved to the headlight on position, power flows from the headlight switch
            (35) through circuit 51, connector (1DRL), circuit 66E, connector (167), resistor (166) and circuit 66D to
            DRL night relay (162) coil. The ground path is circuit 66-GC, and 66-GA to cab ground. This energizes DRL
            night relay (162) and de-energizes DRL day relay (163) which then turns off the Daytime Running Light
            circuitry.
