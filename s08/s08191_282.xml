        <title>Work Light With 48 and 60 Inch Sleeper</title>
        <para>When the work light switch is moved to the on position, power flows from the (B2) battery stud through
            circuit 14T, fuse F2-A, circuit 65A, work light switch (441), and circuit 65B to fuse L4. From the fuse
            power flows on circuit 65E to the left work light, and 65F to the right work light. The ground path is
            circuit 11T to 11F and sleeper ground for the left work light, and circuits 11S, 11T, and 11F to sleeper
            ground for the right work light. With the work light switch in the on position, power also flows from fuse
            F4-A through circuits 13V, 28A, work light indicator light, circuit 65C, work light switch, and circuit
            65-GC, 11-GBD, and 11-GBE to ground adapter (454), thus indicating that the work light switch is turned on.
