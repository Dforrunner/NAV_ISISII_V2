        <para>Power locks, with controls in the driver and passenger doors, will lock or unlock all doors.</para>
        <para>If the remote keyless entry (RKE) option is installed on the vehicle, the key FOB transmitter communicates
            with the RKE receiver module antenna to unlock or lock the doors and courtesy lights for one minute or until
            the ignition switch is turned on. The RKE memory in the receiver learns the transmitter codes from the key
            FOBS (transmitters) and only recognizes those which it has learned in the programming process. Each
            vehicle's has the ability to learn up to four transmitter codes allowing the vehicle to be accessed by four
            different key FOBS. Each key FOB has a unique code which can be learned by any number of RKE equipped
            vehicles.
