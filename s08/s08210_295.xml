        <title>Cab Dome, Reading, and Courtesy Lights</title>
        <para>The two reading lamps are powered through circuits 14H, 14Y, fuse F1-D, and circuit 63P. The circuit then
            splits up to 63R going to the left reading light pigtail connector (312) and circuit 63T going to the right
            reading light pigtail connector (311). The ground circuit for the reading lights is 63-GR (left) or 63-GT
            (right), 11-GAB and 11-GB to right dash panel ground stud.
        </para>
        <para>The dome light switch is illuminated by circuits 62A, 62S, 62AP, and 63F coming from the panel light
            switch. The ground circuit is 62-GF, 11-GAB and 11-GB to right dash panel ground stud. When the dome light
            switch is set to on, power flows from (B2) battery stud through circuits 14AG, 14T, fuse F2-B, and circuit
            63. From this point power flows to left courtesy light through circuit 63V, or right courtesy light through
            circuits 63X and 63V, or right dome light through circuits 63Z, 63, and 63S, or left dome light through
            circuits 63Z, 63, and 63M.
        </para>
        <para>The ground path for the left courtesy light is circuits 63H, 63A, dome light switch, circuits 63-GD,
            11-GAB, and 11-GB to right dash ground stud. The ground path for the right courtesy light is circuits 63H,
            63Y, 63A, dome light switch, circuits 63-GD, 11-GAB, and 11-GB to right dash ground stud.
        </para>
        <para>The ground path for the right dome light is circuits 63Y, 63A, dome light switch, circuits 63-GD, 11-GAB,
            and 11-GB to right dash ground stud. The ground path for the left dome light is circuit 63N, dome light
            switch, circuits 63-GD, 11-GAB, and 11-GB to right dash ground stud. If the dome light switch is set to
            automatic operation, the ground path for all the courtesy and dome lights becomes circuit 63B, and circuit
            63C to ground when a door is opened.
