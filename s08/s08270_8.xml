        <title>IGNITION</title>
        <para>When the key switch (452) is moved to the start or ignition position, power from the (B1) battery stud
            flows through circuits 14BH and 14C, 25A fuse F7-A, circuit 15, the contacts of the key switch, and circuit
            13 to a splice. From the splice, power flows through circuit 13B, 10A fuse F4-A, and circuit 13D to a
            splice. From the splice, power is applied to the following circuits: 13E to the I3 ignition adapter (496),
            47 to speedo and tach gauges, 28A to the right gauge cluster, 28B to the left gauge cluster, 28C to warning
            lights alarm, and 27 to the voltmeter.
        </para>
        <para>With the key switch in the start or ignition position, power also flows through circuit 13, and 13A to the
            coil of the ignition relay (462-R1). This energizes the relay which is grounded through circuits 11-GN and
            11-GB to the right cab ground stud (404). With the relay energized, power flows from the (B1) battery stud
            through circuits 14K and 14R, 20A fuse F2-C, circuit 14S, the N.O. contacts of relay (462-R1), and circuit
            13H to a splice.
        </para>
        <para>From the splice power flows through circuit 13T to heater control relay (463-R5), and power flows through
            circuit 13P, I2 ignition adapter (607), and circuit 13AJ to the USA DRL 10A fuse F10-A [location may vary].
        </para>
        <para>From the splice power flows through circuit 13F to I1 ignition adapter (518). From (518) power flows to
            the following circuits: 13PA to the 5A Detroit Pro Driver display fuse F10-B [location may vary], or Cummins
            Pro Driver display fuse F10-A [location may vary], 13R to the 5A Detroit Horton or Kysor fan fuse F10-A
            [location may vary], 94AJ to the trailer ABS relay (483), 13L to the 10A ether start fuse F10-A [location
            may vary], 13W to the 10A ABS power relay F9-D, 13AB to the 10A pyrometer fuse F10-A [location may vary],
            and 13M to the 10A Qualcomm fuse F10-C [location may vary].
        </para>
        <para>From the splice power also flows through circuit 16A to connector (102), thus feeding the engine ECM,
            optional Spicer Automate transmission, heated air dryer, heated fuel filter, and back-up lights.
