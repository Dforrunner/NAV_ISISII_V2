        <title>SENSOR INPUT</title>
        <svcprocinfo>
            <para>The PT Pacer Control Unit receives an AC (alternating current) voltage from the vehicle speed sensor
                and the engine speed sensor. Both sensors have two pair of leads and are dual coil sensors. Even though
                the resistance of the two coils in each sensor is different, the leads are interchangeable. The
                resistance of one coil is between 900-1100 ohms and the other coil is between 1200-1450 ohms.

            <title>Vehicle Speed Sensor</title>
            <para>The vehicle speed sensor is located at the rear of the transmission. The sensor contains a permanent
                magnetic, which creates a magnetic field, and as the speedometer gear rotates through the magnetic
                field, the field is broken, creating the AC voltage. One lead connects to the PT Pacer Control Unit
                harness and the other lead connects to the engine harness speedometer circuits.

        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Engine Speed Sensor</title>
            <para>The engine speed sensor is located in the engine flywheel housing and the sensor magnetic field is
                broken by the flywheel teeth as it rotates. One lead connects to the PT Pacer Control Unit harness and
                the other connects to the engine harness tachometer circuits.
