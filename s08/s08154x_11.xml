            </para>
            <para>The speedometer and tachometer output signals originate at the engine speed sensor (Engine
                manufacturers component) and at the vehicle speed sensor located at the transmission. These signals are
                sent to the engine Electronic Control Module (ECM). The engine ECM receives the input signals, processes
                them, and sends signals in the form of serial data transmissions over data link circuits to the
                speedo/tach microprocessor. The microprocessor then outputs the information to the speedometer and
                tachometer gauges.
            </para>
            <para>The engine ECM has been factory programmed with the information for various components a vehicle is
                equipped with, such as tire size, axle ratio, and engine model.

                <note>
                    <para>Any changes in vehicle components such as tire size, axle ratio, etc. requires the engine ECM
                        to be reprogrammed and not the speedo/tach microprocessor. Refer to engine manufacturers service
                        manual for information on reprogramming.
