        <para>When the headlight switch is in the park or on position, and the cab and trailer lights switch is on, the
            cab and trailer lights relay is energized and power flows on circuits 68E and 68D through fuse F8-C to
            circuits 68C and 62. From here current flows through panel light switch (425). The panel light switch is
            grounded through circuits 11-GS, 11-GK, and 11-GD to the left dash panel ground stud. The panel light switch
            (425) contains an integrated circuit that provides a variable voltage to adjust the brightness of the panel
            lights.

        <para>From the panel light switch power flows through circuits 62A, 62S, 62M, panel lights feed adapter (503),
            and circuit 62AQ to the analog clock lamp. The ground path is circuit 62-GAQ and 11-GAV to ground adapter
            (454).

        <para>From the panel light switch power flows through circuits 62A, 62S, 62M, panel lights feed adapter (503),
            and circuit 62AB to the air restriction gauge lamp. The ground path is circuit 62-GAB to ground adapter
            (506).

        <para>From the panel light switch power flows through circuits 62A and 62D to the speedo/tach module panel
            lights and through circuits 62-GD and 11-GF to ground stud at left dash panel.

        <para>From the panel light switch power flows through circuits 62A and 62C to the left gauge cluster panel
            lights and through circuits 62-GC and 11-GF to ground stud at left dash panel.

        <para>From the panel light switch power flows through circuits 62A and 62B to the right gauge cluster panel
            lights and through circuits 62-GB and 11-GF to ground stud at left dash panel.
        </para>
        <para>From the panel light switch power flows through circuits 62A and 62T to the cigar lighter light and
            directly to ground.

        <para>From the panel light switch power flows through circuits 62A, 62S, and 62P to the heater control (105)
            light and through circuits 62-GP and 11-G to ground stud at right dash panel.
