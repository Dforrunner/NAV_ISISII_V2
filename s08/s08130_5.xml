            <emph type="bold">Cruise On/Off Switch (244) -</emph>
            The Cruise On/Off switch receives a signal from the ECM on circuit 97AD(5V) and is grounded at the ECM
            (terminal 2).
        </para>
        <para>
            <emph type="bold">Cruise Set/Resume (245) -</emph>The Cruise Set/Resume switch receives a signal from the
            ECM on circuit 97AC(5V) and is grounded on one of two circuits, circuit 97AA (resume position) or 97AB (set
            position), to the ECM (terminal 22 for resume or 12 for set).
        </para>
        <para>
            <emph type="bold">Clutch Pedal Switch -</emph>
            The Clutch Pedal Switch is wired as a normally open switch, but adjusted to be closed when the pedal is in
            the released position. The switch receives a signal from the ECM on circuit 97AF and is grounded to the ECM
            (terminal 4).
        </para>
        <para>
            <emph type="bold">Vehicle Speed Sensor -</emph>The Sensor is a dual coil, two lead sensor. It sends an AC
            signal to the ECM (terminals 3 &#38; 7) and to the vehicle speedometer/tachometer unit. The two coils in the
            sensor have different resistance. The resistance of one coil is 900-1100 ohms and the other coil should be
            1250-1400 ohms. The sensor leads are interchangeable.
