        <title>PANEL LIGHTS ADAPTER</title>
        <para>Power from the headlight switch (410) and panel lights switch (416) is applied to the L1 panel lights feed
            adapter (504), L2 panel lights feed adapter (586), and L5 panel lights feed adapter (508). Power from
            adapter (504) is applied to circuits 62BW and 62T to the cigar lighter light, and from the lighter, circuit
            62AK to the L5 panel lights feed adapter (508).
        </para>
        <para>Power from L1 panel lights adapter (504) is also applied to the following circuits: 66BB and 62BE to
            sleeper fluorescent light switch (563), 62AJ and the left window switch (420), 62V to a splice and circuits
            62N, 62J, 62K and 62L, going to the engine brake and cruise switches, 62AX going to the push button start
            light (541), 62BN going to a splice and circuits 62AL and 62AM going to the driver and passenger right side
            window switch, circuit 62AY going to the ether start switch (451) and circuit 62BW to a splice. From the
            splice, power is applied to circuit 62T and the cigar lighter panel light, circuit 62B to the right gauge
            cluster panel lights, circuit 62C to the left gauge cluster, circuit 62D, 62E to the tachometer and 62F and
            62G to the speedometer.
        </para>
        <para>From L2 panel lights feed adapter (586), power is applied to circuit 62AN and the fog light switch (414)
            and circuit 62AD to a splice. From the splice, power is applied to circuit 62AW going to the work light
            switch (25), circuit 62AT going to the key switch light (495), circuit 62AP going to the dome light switch
            (439), circuit 62P going to the heater control panel light (84), and circuit 62X going to the heated mirror
            switch (415).
        </para>
        <para>Panel light switch (416) applies power to circuit 62A, 62S and a splice. From the splice, power is applied
            to circuits: 62AR to the trailer lights switch (409), 62AS to the headlight switch (410), and 62AV to the
            right motorized mirror switch (540).
        </para>
        <para>Panel light switch (416) applies power to circuit 62A and a splice. From the splice power is applied to
            the following circuits: 62AF to the wipe/wash switch (408), 62AG to the wiper switch (407), 62BA to the
            sleeper dome light switch (589), and 62W to the panel light switch (416).
        </para>
        <para>The ground path for the panel light switch (416) panel light is circuit 62-GW to a splice, and the ground
            path for the panel light switch dimmer's integrated circuit is circuit 11-GS to a splice. Other circuits
            that are grounded through the splice are: 62-GAG to the windshield wiper switch (407), 62-GAF windshield
            wipe/wash switch (408), and 62-GBA to the sleeper dome light switch (589). The splice is grounded through
            circuit 11-GLC, L3 panel lights ground adapter (505), and circuits 11-GP, 11-GLA, and 11-GD to the left cab
            ground stud (429).
        </para>
        <para>The following circuits are also grounded through L3 panel lights adapter (505): 62-GAX to push button
            start switch light (541), 62-GAY to the panel light of ether start switch (451), and 11-GJ to cruise control
            switch circuits 62-GJ and 62-GK, engine brake circuits 62-GN and 62-GL, and engine override diagnostics
            circuit 62-GBK. Adapter (505) is grounded through circuits 11-GP, 11-GLA, and 11-GD to left cab ground stud
