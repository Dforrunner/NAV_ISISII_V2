        <para>The lighted engine brake on/off switch (434) receives a ground signal on circuit 24-G, through connector
            (190) on circuit 97-GA from (1091). In the on position, a ground signal is sent from the switch on circuit
            24AD to engine brake selector switch (433).
        </para>
        <para>When lighted engine brake selector switch (433) is placed in the first position, a ground is applied to
            circuit 24AE, connector (190), and circuit 24AE to the ECM (1091). This tells the ECM to enable the brake
            solenoid for the front three cylinders on the ISM engine and enables the solenoids for two cylinders on the
            AHD engine when braking is called for.
        </para>
        <para>When switch (433) is placed in the second position, a ground is applied to circuit 24AF (and 24AP with the
            AHD), through connector (190) to ECM (1091). This tells the ECM to enable the brake solenoid for the rear
            three cylinders on the ISM engine and enables the solenoids for four cylinders on the AHD engine when
            braking is called for.
        </para>
        <para>When switch (433) is placed in the third position, a ground is placed on circuit 24E. Ground is also
            placed on circuit 24AF (and 24AP with the AHD), through connector (190) to the ECM (1091). This tells the
            ECM to enable the brake solenoids for all cylinders on the ISM engine and the AHD engine when braking is
            called for.
