        <title>Daytime Running Lights (DRL) - USA</title>
        <para>The DRL module (633) receives power from the B1 battery adapter (517), circuit 14BL, 15A fuse F10-B, and
            circuit 66A. The module is grounded through circuit 66-GA to G6 ground adapter (616). When the key switch is
            moved to the ignition position, power is applied to I2 ignition adapter (607), circuit 13AJ, 10A fuse F10-A,
            and circuit 66D to the DRL module (633).
        </para>
        <para>When the parking brakes are released, the DRL park brake switch (293) opens up. Thus the ground path
            through circuit 66E, N.C. park brake switch contacts, and circuit 66-GB to G6 ground adapter (616) is
            removed. This tells the module to power the low beam elements of the headlights at 50% of normal low beam
            brightness, which is 75% to 84% of battery voltage. The power output to the headlights will continue, but be
            overridden by power from the headlight switch, when the switch is moved to the on position.
        </para>
        <para>Power is fed to fog light switch (414) by the DRL module over circuit 64D, connector (N/L), and circuit
            64B. Per federal law, this power is removed whenever high beam headlights are selected. The module knows to
            remove the power to the fog lights when it senses that the high beams are on via circuit 66F, connector
            (N/L), and circuit 66F.
