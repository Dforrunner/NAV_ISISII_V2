            <title>Standard System</title>
            <para>Vehicle batteries are connected in parallel with the positive battery cable connected to the cranking
                motor solenoid "B" terminal. The negative battery cable is connected to the cranking motor ground
                terminal. The engine and a frame rail are then connected by ground cables to the cranking motor ground.

            <title>3+1 Isolated Battery System</title>
            <para>All but one of the vehicle batteries are connected in parallel. The positive battery cable is
                connected to the cranking motor solenoid "B" terminal and to the isolated side of the isolated battery
                magnetic switch. The other battery (deep cycle) is connected to the non-isolated side of the isolated
                battery magnetic switch. Thus when the engine is not running, power for lights and accessories is drawn
                from the deep cycle battery and the remaining batteries are isolated from discharge; consequently, they
                can be used later by the cranking motor to start the engine. The negative battery cable is connected to
                the cranking motor ground terminal. The engine and a frame rail are then connected by ground cables to
                the cranking motor ground.

            <title>Remote Start Terminal</title>
            <para>An optional remote start terminal is connected to the vehicle batteries, which are connected in
                parallel, and provides a more accessible connection point for jump-starting and battery charging. The
                negative cable of the charging source is just clamped to a paint free location on the frame rail.
            </para>
            <para>To use an external power source to charge the deep cycle battery (with 3+1 system) at the same time as
                the cranking batteries, a jumper cable must be used to connect the positive deep cycle battery terminal
                to the positive terminal of a cranking battery.
