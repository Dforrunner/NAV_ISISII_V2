            <title>Battery Power</title>
            <para>The vehicle batteries are connected in parallel and provide power, via the positive battery cable, to
                the cranking motor solenoid "B" stud.
            </para>
            <para>The negative battery terminals are also connected in parallel and provide a ground path, via the
                negative battery cable, to the cranking motor ground stud. The frame, engine block, and the cab platform
                are also interconnected by ground cables to the battery ground.
            </para>
            <para>For additional information on the operating principles for batteries, refer to GROUP 08 - ELECTRICAL,
                in the Master Service Manual.

            <title>Cranking System and Circuits</title>
            <para>With the transmission in neutral (neutral position switch contacts closed) power flows from the key
                switch (20) through circuit A13/A13A/A13K, fuse F10, circuit A97P, engine cab connector (2) and circuit
                K97P to the neutral position switch. Power flows through the switch contacts, circuit K97AU, circuit
                K97L to the crank inhibit relay (R2) switch. With a manual transmission, a jumper bypasses the neutral
                position switch. A splice also provides the current from K97AU to ECM (6020) through circuit A97A,
                engine cab connector (2) and circuit A97A. This informs the ECM that the transmission is in neutral or
                the clutch pedal is depressed.
            </para>
            <para>With the vehicle in neutral and the key switch (20) in the start position, current flows from the (J2)
                battery feed stud through circuit A14, a splice, circuit A19, fuse F16, circuit A15, and to the key
                switch (20). From the key switch, current flows through circuit A17F to the crank inhibit relay (R2)
                coil. If cranking is enabled the relay coil is grounded through circuit A97H and the engine cab
                connector (2) to ECM (6020).
            </para>
            <para>The energized crank inhibit relay (R2) controls the start relay (387) by supply power to the relay
                coil through circuit K17A, cab connector (2) and circuit K17F. The coil is ground through circuit K17S
                to the crank motor ground stud.
            </para>
            <para>For additional information on the operating principles for cranking motors, refer to GROUP 08 -
                ELECTRICAL in the CTS-5000 Master Service Manual.

        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Cranking System and Circuits - Starter Relay Switch</title>
            <para>Battery power is always present at the crank motor solenoid (B) terminal through the 4/0 positive
                battery cable. The 3/0 negative battery cable is attached to the crank motor ground stud which is
                grounded to the frame rail. Power is also available at the start relay (387) through the solenoid (B)
                terminal and circuit K17-FL/K17B. With the starter relay energized, power flows through the closed
                contacts and circuit K17A to the (S) terminal of the crank motor solenoid which energizes the solenoid.
            </para>
            <para>With the crank motor solenoid energized, the solenoid engages the crank motor's shaft to rotate. When
                the engine starts and the key is released, power is removed from circuit K17S which de-energizes the
                start relay (387) and disengages the crank motor.
            </para>
        </svcsubproc>
        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Cranking System and Circuits - Cranking Motor Thermal Overcrank Protection</title>
            <para>On vehicles with optional crank motor thermal overcrank protection, the starter relay control coil
                ground K17D is connected to the normally closed thermal overcrank protection switch (N/L) located in the
                end of the cranking motor. The overcrank protection switch is grounded through circuits K17D, K17-G, and
                K11-G to the crank motor ground stud.
            </para>
            <para>If excessive cranking causes the crank motor temperature to exceed a pre-set temperature limit, the
                thermal overcrank protection switch contacts open and causes the starter relay to de-energize and the
                crank motor to disengage. When the crank motor cools, the thermal switch contacts reset and the crank
                motor can be engaged.
            </para>

        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Charging System</title>
            <para>With the engine running, the function of the alternator is to produce direct current (DC) in order to
                supply power to the vehicle electrical system, and to charge the batteries.
            </para>
            <para>The alternator supplies the vehicle electrical system through the alternator (+) terminal, circuits K2
                and K14, to the (J2) battery feed stud.
            </para>
            <para>Any current above the needs of the vehicle electrical system is used to supply the batteries. The
                alternator charges the batteries through the (+) terminal, circuits K2, K14A, K14-FL and K14A-FL to the
                "B" terminal of the crank motor solenoid and through the battery cable to the battery positive terminal.
            </para>
            <para>The ground path for the alternator is the (-) terminal, and circuit K2-G to the crank motor ground
                stud.
            </para>
            <para>For additional information on the operating principles for alternators, refer to GROUP 08 - ELECTRICAL
                in the CTS-5000 Master Service Manual.
            </para>
        </svcsubproc>
        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Charging System - Ammeter (Shunt)</title>
            <para>The optional ammeter gauge indicates the rate of charge of electric current supplied by the alternator
                to the batteries, or the rate of discharge from the batteries.
            </para>
            <para>When the alternator produces more current than the vehicle electrical circuits demand, the additional
                output charges the batteries, and the ammeter indicates the charge through circuits K26-FL, engine cab
                connector (15) and K26 to the ammeter.
            </para>
            <para>When the electrical circuits demand more current than the alternator produces, current flows from the
                batteries to the vehicle electrical system, and the ammeter shows a discharge through circuits K26A-FL,
                engine cab connector (15) and K26A to the ammeter.
