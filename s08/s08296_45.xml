            <title>Horn(s)</title>
            <para>Power is applied from the battery feed stud (1F) to circuit A14D/A14A, fuse F11, and circuit A85 to
                the coil of the horn relay (R6). When the horn button is depressed, power flows through the horn relay
                coil, circuit A85A, an in-line connector (14), pin 1, circuit 85A, another in-line connector, and
                circuit 85A to the steering wheel slip ring. From the slip ring, power flows through circuit 85A, the
                horn button switch and circuit 85-GB to the steering column ground.
            </para>
            <para>With the horn relay energized, power flows from circuit A85, through circuit A85B, the horn relay
                (R6), circuit A85C, dash connector (2), pin C4, and circuit N85C to the high note horn (9151A), and
                circuit N85D to the low note horn (9151),. The horns are grounded through the mounting bolts (9150), and
                through circuit N85-G/N11-GG to the platform ground (9000A).

            <title>Turn Signals</title>
            <para>Power for the turn signal circuitry is supplied by the feed stud (1F) through circuit A14D/A14A, fuse
                F13, and circuit A55 to the flasher unit (1) (F35). Power is then supplied through circuit A55A/A60A,
                turn signal jumper harness connector (13), pin C, and circuit A55A/A60A to the turn signal switch (62)
                [through circuit A55A/60A, turn signal jumper harness connector (13), pin C, and circuit A55A/60A to the
                turn signal switch (95) with tilt steering column].
            </para>
            <para>When the turn signal is moved to the left turn position, the switch contacts close and power is
                applied to the jumper harness circuit A56, jumper connector (13), pin D, and circuit A56 to a splice.
                From the splice, power is supplied to the body builder connector (169), pin F, on circuit A56C. From the
                splice, power is also applied through circuit A56B, the green dash cluster connector (11), pin 6, and a
                printed circuit board to the left turn indicator light. The light is grounded through the printed
                circuit, connector (11), pin 2, and circuit A28-G/A11-G to the platform ground (1PG).
            </para>
            <para>From the turn signal switch, power is also supplied to the body builder connector (170), pin E,
                through the jumper harness circuit A56A, jumper connector (13), pin E, and circuit A56A.
            </para>
            <para>When the turn signal is moved to the right turn position, the switch contacts close and power is
                applied to the jumper harness circuit A57, jumper connector (13), pin F, and circuit A57 to a splice.
                From the splice, power is supplied to the body builder connector (169), pin G, on circuit A57C. From the
                splice, power is also applied through circuit A57B, the green dash cluster connector (11), pin 12, and a
                printed circuit board to the right turn indicator light. The light is grounded through the printed
                circuit, connector (11), pin 2, and circuit A28-G/A11-G to the platform ground (1PG).
            </para>
            <para>From the turn signal switch, power is also supplied to the body builder connector (170), pin B,
                through the jumper harness circuit A57A, jumper connector (13), pin A, and circuit A57A.
            </para>
            <para>When the hazard button is pushed, switch contacts close and power is applied to all of the previously
                discussed feed circuits. This causes the indicator lights to flash and any lights connected to the turn
                signal circuitry in the body builder connectors (169) and (170).
            </para>

        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Power Source</title>
            <para>Power for the power source outlet is supplied by the feed stud (1F) through circuit 14XZ, fuse F30,
                and circuit 14XY to the power source connector (208). The ground path for the power source connector
                (208) is circuit 14XX to the platform ground (1PG).
