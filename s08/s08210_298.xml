        <title>Headlight Switch and Dimmer Switch Wiring</title>
        <para>The headlight switch and dimmer switch wiring circuits along with the headlight relay, all covered in this
            section, regulate power to the headlights, tail lights, marker lights, fog lights and daytime running light
            circuits. When the headlight switch is placed in accessory or on (ignition) position, power is available
            from (B2) battery stud, through circuits 14H, 14D, fuse F8-A, circuit 50, headlights switch (465), and
            circuit 58E to the cab and trailer lights switch.
        </para>
        <para>If the headlight switch is placed in on (ignition) position, power is available from (B2) battery stud,
            through circuit 14H, 14B, fuse F3-D, and circuit 50A to the headlights switch (465). If the headlight switch
            is on, current will flow through the switch and circuit 50B to energize the headlight relay (462-R4).
            Circuits 50-GB and 11-G complete the ground circuit.
        </para>
        <para>With the headlight relay energized, current flows from (B2) battery stud, through circuits 14H, 14D, fuse
            F8-B, circuit 51, headlight relay (462-R4), and circuit 51A, to dimmer switch (42). With the dimmer switch
            in the low position, current will flow through circuit 53B to a splice. From the splice power will flow
            through circuit 53D to the left headlight and 53C to the right headlight. Then the current will flow through
            circuits 52-GE, 52-GF, and 11-GF to ground stud at left dash panel. With the dimmer switch in the high
            position, current will flow through circuit 52F to a splice. From the splice power will flow through circuit
            52D to the left headlight and 52E to the right headlight. Then the current will flow through circuits 52-GE,
            52-GF, and 11- GF to ground stud at left dash panel.
        </para>
        <para>With the standard USA and Canadian DRL system, with the headlight switch off, power flows from the DRL
            module through circuits 66B, 64C, and 53B to a splice. From the splice power will flow through circuit 53D
            to the left headlight and 53C to the right headlight. Then the current will flow through circuits 52-GE,
            52-GF, and 11-GF to the ground stud at the left dash panel.
