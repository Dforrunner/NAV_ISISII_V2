            <title>Hydraulic Brake System</title>
            <para>The Bendix Hydro-Max II hydraulic brake booster is offered on all hydraulic brake models. It powers a
                split system which protects against brake failure by using separate fluid lines to feed the front and
                rear axle brakes. The master cylinder provides fluid pressurized by the power steering pump and the
                Hydro-Max II booster to activate the brake pads against the disc or drums. It is a dual mode system
                which will automatically provide back-up brake power, from an electric/hydraulic pump, should there be a
                loss of power steering pump pressure.
            </para>
            <para>A warning light and alarm, which can indicate various hydraulic and electrical malfunctions, are
                standard.
            </para>
            <para>A hydraulic brake and stop light switch each signal the engine Electronic Control Module (ECM) when
                the brakes are applied. The ECM uses these signals to control the cruise and engine remote controls,
                cold ambient protection and idle shutdown timer systems.

        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Heated Fuel Filter With Water-in-Fuel Light, Fuel Filter Restriction Light</title>
            <para>The fuel filter heater is mounted in the fuel filter and when operating, it helps prevent fuel from
                gelling in the unfiltered side of the filter. The system consists of a fuel heater relay (with 1152SC,
                1552SC) or an ignition relay (with 1652SC), the filter heating element, and a normally open
                thermoswitch. The switch contacts close at approximately 45&#176;F.
            </para>
            <para>The water-in-fuel system consists of a control module, a water probe, and a warning light in the dash
                cluster. When water is present in the fuel filter, increased current will flow from the probe to ground.
                The module senses this increase and turns on the warning light.
            </para>
            <para>The fuel filter restriction light is activated when the fuel filter becomes restricted. This causes
                the fuel filter vacuum switch contacts to close and activates the light.
            </para>
        </svcsubproc>
        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Suspension Low Air Pressure Warning</title>
            <para>The air suspension system permits the driver to lower the frame by releasing air from the suspension
                air bags through a cab control valve. The system includes an alarm and warning light which are activated
                when low air pressure in the system is detected. The system is also protected from inadvertently
                releasing air when the ignition key switch is on.
            </para>
        </svcsubproc>
        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Allison (Non Electronic) Automatic Transmission - 1652SC</title>
            <para>With the Allison electrically controlled transmission, the modulator shift solenoid is controlled by
                the engine computer. The system consists of a modulator solenoid relay, a modulator shift solenoid and a
                neutral position switch which is provided to prevent the truck from being started when in gear.
