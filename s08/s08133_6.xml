        <title>ELECTRONIC CONTROL MODULE (ECM)</title>
        <svcprocinfo>
            <para>The "Brain" of the engine control system is two components working together: the Electronic Control
                Module (ECM) and the Vehicle Personality Module (VPM). The ECM is mounted on the left side of the engine
                and the VPM is mounted on the ECM. The ECM is the computer which controls the engine. The VPM contains
                the operating instructions (software) including owner selected parameters and other engine information
                for the ECM to use, controlling how the ECM behaves.
            </para>
            <para>The International vehicle's electrical system connects to the Caterpillar ECM using International
                40-pin ECM connector, C320. ECM connector C320 connects to the Caterpillar engine harness 40-pin
                connector (J7). All electronic communication between the International electrical system and the
                Caterpillar engine control system go through the C320/J7 connection.
            </para>
            <para>The ECM receives operating power (12 volt DC) from the vehicle batteries through International engine
                harness ECM connector (C320) when the ignition key switch is ON (IGN position).
            </para>
            <para>The ECM is intended to operate on 12V, but will tolerate voltage as low as 6 volts during cranking, or
                9 volts during engine operation. The ECM is protected against power surges on the 12 volt power supply
                due to alternator load dumps, air conditioner clutches, etc. and for jump starting.
            </para>
            <para>The ECM acts as power supply for many Caterpillar and International components used to monitor and
                control the engine/vehicle systems.

            <title>Inputs And Outputs</title>
            <para>The ECM is connected to the International installed switches that communicate with the ECM. The
                switches are 2-way or 3-way switches and are either ON or OFF.
            </para>
            <para>EXAMPLE OF A 2-WAY SWITCH: The ECM needs to know if the Cruise Control switch is either ON or OFF. To
                accomplish this the switch is connected to the ECM with two circuits.
            </para>
            <seqlist>
                <item>
                    <para>Each International installed switch has an "input" circuit that is connected through ECM
                        connector (320) to an assigned ECM terminal. This circuit has 5 volts applied at the ECM
                        terminal.
                    </para>
                </item>
                <item>
                    <para>Each switch is connected to a "common" or ground circuit that is connected through ECM
                        connector (320) terminal #2 to ECM ground (part of Caterpillar harness).
                    </para>
                </item>
                <item>
                    <para>When the switch is OPEN (cruise off), the ECM will see 5 volts present at the input circuit
                        terminal of the ECM. Turning the cruise switch to the ON position, CLOSING the switch causes the
                        ECM to see 0 volts (ground voltage will be 0 to 0.5 volts). The ECM programming has established
                        that the Cruise Control Switch is OFF when it sees 5 volts from ECM connector (320) terminal 10
                        at ECM terminal 36, or cruise is ON when the ECM sees 0 volts.
                    </para>
                </item>
            </seqlist>
            <para>EXAMPLE: The service brake switch (69) is connected by input circuit (97AL) to ECM connector (320)
                terminal #30. Terminal #30 has a 5-volt signal present. With the brake switch closed (pedal released)
                the circuit is complete between terminals #30 (input) and #2 (common or ground). This causes the 5-volt
                signal at terminal #30 to go to zero. This tells the ECM that the service brake switch is closed (pedal
                released).
            </para>
            <para>This type of circuit is used to communicate switch and some sensor information to the ECM. Some
                sensors receive a 5 volt signal and return a variable voltage indicating some variable attribute. The
                ECM also uses 12-volt circuits to enable (activate) relays in the system.
            </para>
            <para>The ECM receives "inputs" through ECM connector (320) from the following International components:

            <para>The ECM also receives and processes information from Caterpillar sensors and switches used to control
                engine operation including: rack and timing, the fuel shutoff valve, and other engine components. For
                information on engine operation, refer to the appropriate Caterpillar manual.

            <title>Key ON - Battery Power To ECM</title>
            <para>The ECM receives battery power from ECM connector (320) terminal #1 whenever the Ignition Key Switch
                is in the IGN position.
            </para>
            <para>The battery power to the ECM is switched ON or OFF by the RUN RELAY (64), which is energized by
                turning the key switch to the IGN position.
            </para>
            <seqlist>
                <item>
                    <para>Turning the key switch to the IGN position energizes the RUN RELAY. Voltage from the key
                        switch (circuit 13A/19A) through F4, 20 amp fuse* is applied (circuit 97A) to the RUN RELAY
                        control coil terminal (86) causing the relay to energize. The RUN RELAY control coil ground path
                        is circuit 11-DB to the cab ground.
                    </para>
                    <para>*The F4 fuse is located in the main fuse block.</para>
                </item>
                <item>
                    <para>2.The RUN RELAY normally open terminal (87) has battery power present from F11, 20 amp fuse.
                        Fuse F11 receives power on circuit 14D from the "BATT" terminal of the start magnetic switch.
                        The battery power is present at terminal 87 at all times, key on or off.
                    </para>
                    <para>Energizing the RUN RELAY causes battery power from F11 to flow through the relay (normally
                        open terminal 87 to common terminal 30) then on circuit 97B to fuse F27. From F27 fuse, circuit
                        97F delivers battery power through the cab and engine harness to ECM connector (320) terminal
                        #1.
                    </para>
                </item>
            </seqlist>
            <para>It is important to note that 12V battery power from RUN RELAY is also distributed to the Throttle
                Position Sensor (TPS) and the Vehicle Speed Buffer.
