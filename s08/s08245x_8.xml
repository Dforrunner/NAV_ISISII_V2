            <title>Speedometer/Tachometer Module</title>
            <para>The speedometer/tachometer output signals originate at the engine speed sensor (engine manufacturer's
                component) and at the vehicle speed sensor located at the transmission. These signals are sent to the
                engine Electronic Control Module (ECM). The engine ECM receives the input signals, processes them, and
                sends the signals in the form of serial data transmissions over the data link circuits to the
                speedometer/tachometer.
            </para>
            <para>The engine ECM has been factory programmed with the information for various components a vehicle is
                equipped with, such as tire size, axle ratio, and engine model.

                <note>
                    <para>Any changes in vehicle components such as tire size, axle ratio, etc. requires the engine ECM
                        to be reprogrammed and not the speedometer/tachometer microprocessor. Refer to engine
                        manufacturer's service manual for information on reprogramming.

            <title>Speedometer</title>
            <para>The vehicle speed signal is generated by the vehicle speed sensor (225) located on top of the
                transmission. This sensor contains a permanent magnet that creates a magnetic field. The sensor is
                mounted so that the magnetic field is repeatedly broken by a 16-tooth speedometer gear on the
                transmission. As the field is broken, an AC (alternating current) pulse is generated. This pulse is sent
                on circuits 97AK and 97AJ to the ECM (refer to Vehicle Speed Signal From ECM, below).
            </para>
            <para>The signal from the vehicle speed sensor is used for cruise control, engine brakes, and other
                functions. The ECM processes the signal from the vehicle speed sensor and sends a signal in the form of
                a serial data transmission over the ATA data link circuit (a positive and negative pair of twisted
                wires) to the Speedometer/Tachometer module through connector (421). The signal is also present at the
                ATA data link connector (220) and vehicle speed can be read using an electronic service tool (EST). For
                additional information on the data link, refer to GROUP 08 - ELECTRICAL, Electronic Engine Controls, in
                the CTS-5000 Master Service Manual.

            <para>The Speedometer/Tachometer control module processes the input signal and drives the 4-pin electronic

                same except for the gauge markings.

            <para>The speedometer/tachometer processor will advance the odometer in 1/10 mile steps, based on the input
                signal over the data link from the engine ECM. Tire revolutions per mile, and axle ratios are the major
                factors in determining the correct signal.
                <emph type="bold">The ECM must be properly programmed to reflect the vehicle configuration.</emph>
                Other factors that can affect tire revolutions per mile are tire manufacturing tolerances, tire load,
