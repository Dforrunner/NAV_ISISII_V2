        <title>DIAGNOSTIC TELLTALES</title>
        <para>Several diagnostic features are included in the electronic control system to assist in troubleshooting
            malfunctions and/or to monitor specific operating parameters. These features include a CHECK TRANS light on
            the instrument panel and the Data Link Connector for using an electronic service tool. When a malfunction is
            detected in the control system, a series of "diagnostic codes" are used to identify and clarify the nature
            of the malfunction.
        </para>
        <para>CHECK TRANS light - The red CHECK TRANS light is located in the instrument cluster. A system check is
            performed when turning the ignition key to the on position to start the vehicle. The CHECK TRANS light is
            activated until the vehicle is started, then it will deactivate, unless a system fault is detected by the
            ECU.
        </para>
        <para>If a system fault that inhibits the transmission operation is detected by the ECU, the CHECK TRANS light
            will illuminate, accompanied by eight seconds of short beeps from the shift selector, indicating that
            transmission shifts are being restricted. The SELECT digit on the shift display will be blank. Vehicle
            operation may continue in order to reach service assistance. The ECU may not respond to shift selector
            requests, since operating limitations are being placed on the transmission; i.e., upshifts and downshifts
            may be restricted.
            <emph type="bold">Directional changes (forward to reverse for example) will not occur.</emph>
        </para>
        <para>Any time the CHECK TRANS light has been illuminated, the ECU will register a diagnostic code. It may be
            identified on the shifter display (discussed in
            <hotlnk document="s08246_32.xml" xrefid="x0824601">TROUBLESHOOTING</hotlnk>) and/or using an electronic
            service tool.
        </para>
        <para>Minor conditions can occur that will cause a diagnostic code to be registered in the ECU, but will not
            illuminate the CHECK TRANS light or restrict transmission operation.
        </para>
        <para>DATA LINK CONNECTOR - The data link connector is used to connect an electronic service tool to the
            transmission electronic control system. The electronic service tool diagnostic codes and other related
            information will be discussed in the
