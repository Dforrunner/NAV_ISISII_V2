        <svcprocinfo>
            <para>On-line Diagnostics are automatically performed while the key is in the accessory or ignition
                position. Any faults encountered will be entered in the active diagnostic trouble code list.

            <title>Check Electrical System Light</title>
            <para>The check electrical system light will turn on for 5 seconds after the gauge sweep, on power up. If
                there is an active fault the light will stay on for an extra minute. If a fault occurs during operation
                of the vehicle the light will come on for 1 minute. This will alert the driver that an active fault
                exists.
            </para>
            <para>If the check electrical system light comes on and stays on after the gauge sweep is completed there is
                an active diagnostic trouble code (DTC) or there is no communication between the EGC and ESC.
            </para>
            <para>If the EGC loses communication with the ESC or engine controller the check electrical system light
                will turn on and stay on. The light will be accompanied by 10 short beeps from the EGC alarm.

            <title>Gauges</title>
            <para>Gauge warning lamps will illuminate and be accompanied by the appropriate alarm when gauge readings
                exceed preset limits. Gauges will also respond when the ESC is not receiving input from sensors.

            <title>Flashing Switch Lamps</title>
            <para>Several features activated by switches in the switch packs are programmed to flash the indicator lamp
                in the switch when there is a switch malfunction or a malfunctioning feature.
            </para>
            <para>Not all switches will respond the same. Generally a malfunctioning switch will cause the indicator to
                flash at a slow rate. A problem with the feature will cause the indicator to flash at a fast rate. Refer
                to the section on the particular feature for details on how the switch indicator responds to failures.
