            <para>This section includes troubleshooting charts for International installed circuits and components that
                are part of the CELECT PLUS Electronic Control system. To begin the troubleshooting process, refer to
                the appropriate Cummins manual and follow their directions. If the Cummins diagnostics (fault codes)
                indicate that the suspect circuits are International circuits or components, then use the charts in this
                section.
            </para>
            <para>The Pro-Link DDR can also be used to determine if the International switches and components are
                working properly. If they are not, use a Fluke digital multimeter (DMM) to troubleshoot the circuits.
            </para>
            <para>If the CELECT PLUS diagnostic codes or the Pro-Link indicates a problem with International installed
                circuits, the diagnostic tables in this chapter provide step-by-step test procedures.
            </para>
            <para>Before beginning these test procedures, do the following:</para>

                <item>
                    <para>Make sure the vehicle batteries are at 75% state of charge (SOC) or higher. This represents an
                        open circuit voltage (OCV) of 12.4 volts. Batteries with an OCV of 12 volts or less are either
                        completely discharged or have a dead cell.
                    </para>

                <item>
                    <para>Check any light or indicator lamp filaments that are suspected of being open (burned out).
                        This is done to avoid unnecessary extensive circuit checks.

                <item>
                    <para>Inspect all connectors for loose or damaged pins, wires, etc. Refer to TEST EQUIPMENT AND
                        CONNECTOR REPAIR section in GROUP 08 - ELECTRICAL in the CTS-5000 Master Service Manual.

                    <para>When the technician determines that a fuse is blown, while checking its condition, he is
                        directed to locate the cause of the overload condition and to repair it. While no further
                        instruction on this procedure is listed in the diagnostic tables, the common procedure is as
                        follows: isolate sections of the circuit, by disconnecting connectors, and measure the
                        resistance to ground to find the circuit that is shorted to ground. Then locate the damaged spot
                        in the wire or connector and repair.

                <item>
                    <para>Diagnostics for circuits that are malfunctioning by sticking in the on position are generally
                        not covered in detail. It is assumed that the technician knows to check for a malfunctioning
                        switch, relay, or solenoid.

            <para>All CELECT PLUS vehicles have a yellow Engine Warning light and a red Engine Stop light located in the
                telltale lights in the instrument cluster. Every time the key is turned to the ignition position, the

            <para>If the warning lights remain on, it is an indication that the ECM has detected a problem. The CELECT

                are recorded in the ECM.

            <para>If a fault is detected (becomes active) during vehicle operation, the driver is alerted by the
