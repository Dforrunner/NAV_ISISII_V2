        <title>OPERATION</title>
        <para>When key switch (40) is moved to the ignition position, power is applied to I2 ignition adapter (495),
            circuit 13AT, and the coil of auxiliary blower relay (147). The ground path for the auxiliary blower relay
            is circuits 13-GAT, 75-GH, 75-GN, and 11-GBD to ground adapter (454). This energizes the auxiliary bunk
            blower relay (147) and allows power to flow from (B2) battery stud through circuits 14AK, 14AU, 15A fuse
            F10-B [location may vary], circuit 75AX, aux. bunk relay (147) N.O. contacts, circuit 75AS, connector (906),
            circuits 75AS and 75AR to bunk heater blower switch (593).
        </para>
        <para>When the bunk heater blower switch (593) is moved to the low speed position, power flows through circuit
            75AC, connector (N/L), circuit 75AC, resistor and thermo fuse assembly, circuit 75AT, connector (48),
            circuit 75AT, sleeper high speed relay (584) N.C. contacts, circuit 75AF, connector (48), and circuit 75AF
            to the sleeper blower motor. This causes the blower motor to run at low speed. The blower motor ground path
            is circuit 75-GA, connector (48), circuits 75-GA and 11-GBD to ground adapter (454).
        </para>
        <para>When the bunk blower switch (593) is moved to the medium speed position, power flows through circuit 75AN
            to the sleeper medium speed relay (585). The ground path for the sleeper medium speed relay (585) is
            circuits 75-GN and 11-GBD to ground adapter (454). This energizes the sleeper medium speed relay (585) and
            allows power to flow from (B2) battery stud through circuits 14AK, 14AU, fuse F10-A, circuits 75AW, 75AB,
            sleeper medium speed relay (585) N.O. contacts, circuit 75AM, connector (48), circuit 75AM, resistor and
            thermo fuse assembly (N/L), circuit 75AT, connector (48), circuit 75AT, sleeper high speed relay (584) N.C.
            contacts, circuit 75AF, connector (48), and circuit 75AF to sleeper blower motor. This causes the blower
            motor to run at medium speed. The blower ground path is circuit 75-GA, connector (48), circuits 75-GA and
            11-GBD to ground adapter (454).
        </para>
        <para>When the bunk blower switch (593) is moved to the high speed position, power flows through the switch,
            circuit 75AH to the sleeper high speed relay (584). The ground path for the sleeper high speed relay (584)
            is circuits 75-GH, 75-GN, and 11-GBD to ground adapter (454). This energizes the sleeper high speed relay
            (584) and allows power to flow from (B2) battery stud through circuits 14AK, 14AU, 30A fuse F10-A [location
            may vary], circuits 75AW, 75AD, sleeper high speed relay (584) N.O. contacts, circuit 75AF, connector (48),
            and circuit 75AF to sleeper blower motor. This causes the blower motor to run at high speed.
        </para>
        <para>The blower ground path is circuit 75-GA, connector (48), circuits 75-GA and 11-GBD to ground adapter
            (454).
        </para>
        <para>When the key switch (40) is moved to the ignition position, power is also made available by the auxiliary
            bunk relay (147) to circuit 75AS, connector (80), circuits 75AS and 75AL to sleeper automatic temperature
            control connector (592). The ground path for the sleeper temperature control is through connector (592),
            circuits 75-GS to sleeper ground stud and 11-GAN to B-pillar ground stud.
        </para>
        <para>As above, power is also made available by the auxiliary bunk relay (147) to circuit 75L, connector (162),
            and circuit 75L to the heater box damper flat pack. The heater box damper flat pack is grounded through
            circuit 75-GL, connector (161), circuits 75-G and 11-G to right dash panel ground stud. The flat pack
            receives a variable voltage from the sleeper automatic temperature control through connector (592), circuit
            75K, connector (906), circuit 75K, connector (162), and circuit 75K. Thus the damper blends hot and cold air
            as selected by the sleeper temperature control.
        </para>
        <para>When the key switch (40) is in ignition position and the bunk heater blower switch (593) is in low,
            medium, or high position, power is applied to circuit 77L and the sleeper A/C On/Off switch (905). When the
            switch is moved to the on position, the internal indicator lamp illuminates as power flows through it, and
            ground circuits 77-GL to sleeper ground stud and 11-GAN, connector (942), and circuit 11-GAN to B-pillar
            ground stud. When the switch is moved to on position, power is also supplied to the A/C control relay (144)
            by way of the blocking diode, connector (905), circuit 77M, connector (906), circuits 77M and 77K. Thus the
            A/C compressor will engage, if it is not already running (the compressor will cycle with the thermostatic
            switch), and cooling will be available for the sleeper blower.
