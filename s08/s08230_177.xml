            <title>ECM Power and Ground</title>
            <para>Power is supplied from the batteries to circuit 14A, a 40A power relay fuse, circuit 14B, positive
                battery connector (412), circuit 14B, battery harness connector (426), and circuit 14B to the Electronic
                Control Module (ECM) power relay (396) contacts.
            </para>
            <para>Power is also supplied from the (J1) battery feed stud to circuit 14B, fuse F11, circuit 97CT, the
                22-pin bulkhead connector (3), and circuit 97CT to the ECM power relay coil. From the relay, power is
                applied to circuit 97AH and pin 25 of the ECM (379).
            </para>
            <para>When key switch (24) is moved to the ignition position, power is supplied to circuit 13A, fuse F5,
                circuit 97CR, the 22-pin bulkhead connector (3), and circuit 97CR to pin 24 of the ECM (379). This
                signals the ECM that the ignition switch is on and causes the ECM to internally switch pin 25 to ground.
                This completes the circuit for ECM power relay (396) and energizes the relay. With the relay energized,
                power is applied through the relay contacts to circuit 97CM and a splice. From the splice power is
                applied to the ECM pins 21, 22, and 41 on circuits 97CL, 97CK, and 97AL respectively.
            </para>
            <para>Grounds for the ECM pins 1, 2, 23, and 42 are through circuits 11-GW, 11-GX, 11-GY and 11-GZ
                respectively, to a splice. From the splice, ground is through circuit 11-G, the battery harness
                connector (426), circuit 11-G, negative battery connector (665) and circuit 11-G to the negative battery
                terminal.
