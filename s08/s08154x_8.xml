            </para>
            <para>The speedometer and tachometer gauges are driven by inputs from the microprocessor which is driven by
                the vehicle speed sensor, located at the transmission, and an engine speed sensor, located at the engine
                flywheel housing.
            </para>
            <para>The sensors are magnetic pick-up devices which sense the rotation of the speedometer gear and the
                flywheel ring gear. A permanent magnet located in these sensors establishes a magnetic field at the tip
                of the sensor. The magnetic field is repeatedly interrupted by the gear teeth, creating voltage impulses
                that are transmitted to the microprocessor.

            </para>
            <para>The speedometer and tachometer sensor output signals originate at the engine speed sensor (Engine
                manufacturers component) and at the vehicle speed sensor located at the transmission. These signals are
                sent to the engine Electronic Control Module (ECM). The engine ECM receives the input signals, processes
                them, and sends signals in the form of serial data transmissions over data link circuits to the
                speedo/tach microprocessor. The microprocessor then outputs the information to the speedometer and
                tachometer gauges.
            </para>
            <para>The engine ECM has been factory programmed with the information for various components a vehicle is
                equipped with, such as tire size, axle ratio, and engine model.

                    <para>Any changes in vehicle components such as tire size, axle ratio, etc. requires the engine ECM
                        to be reprogrammed and not the speedo/tach microprocessor. Refer to engine manufacturers service
                        manual for information on reprogramming.

            <para>The speedometer and tachometer sensor output signals originate at the engine speed sensor installed in
                the engine (Engine manufacturers component) and at the vehicle speed sensor located at the transmission.
            </para>
            <para>The engine speed sensor transmits a signal to the engine Electronic Control Module (ECM) which
                calculates the engine speed. The engine ECM sends the calculated engine speed (RPM) as a digital signal
                to the engine Vehicle Personality Module (VPM). The engine VPM buffers this signal and sends a signal to
                the speedo/tach microprocessor.
            </para>
            <para>The vehicle speed sensor sends an AC signal to the engine VPM. The engine VPM has been programmed with
                the correct rear axle ratio and tire size information. The engine VPM uses this programmed information
                and the speed sensor input to create the vehicle speed signal which is sent to the speedo/tach
                microprocessor.
