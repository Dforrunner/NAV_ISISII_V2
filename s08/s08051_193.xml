        <title>PARK/TURN/MARKER LIGHTS 9200 AND 9400</title>
        <para>When the headlight switch is in the park or position, and the cab and trailer lights switch is ON, the cab
            and trailer lights relay is energized and power flows on circuits 68E and 68D through fuse F8-C to circuits
            68C and 58H. Then the current is split through circuit 58T to the left park/turn/marker light low element
            and circuit 58U to the right park/turn/marker light low element. The ground circuits are 56-G from the left
            light and 57-G from the right light through 52GA to J7 cab ground.
        </para>
        <para>The turn signal switch provides power on circuit 56D to the left side turn light element and circuit 56 to
            the left/park/turn/marker light high element.
        </para>
        <para>The turn signal switch provides power on circuit 57D to the right side turn light element and circuit 57
            to the right/park/turn/marker light high element.
        </para>
        <para>The ground path for the park/turn/marker lights was mentioned above. The ground path for the left side
            turn light is circuit 56-GA and 11-GD to ground stud at left dash panel. The ground path for the right side
            turn light is circuit 57-GA, and 11-GB to ground stud at right dash panel.
