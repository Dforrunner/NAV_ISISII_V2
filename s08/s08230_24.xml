                78A going to heated mirror relay (102). When key switch (24) is moved to the ignition or accessory
                position, voltage is present at circuit 12, (J2) junction block, circuit 12B, fuse F19 and circuit 78
                going to heated mirror switch (101). With power windows, voltage is also present on circuit 83B which
                feeds circuit 83A going to the power windows. When the heated mirror switch (101) is moved to the on
                position, power flows through its indicator lamp to ground on circuits 78-GB and 78-GA causing it to
                illuminate. Power also flows through circuit 78B, the heated mirror relay coil (102), and ground
                circuits 78-GE and 78-GA to cab ground.

            <para>Power also flows through circuit 78D, connector (106), circuit 78-D/78-D2, connector (125)/(107), the
                green wire, and connector (108) to the right heated convex mirror. Its ground path is through conn.
                (108), the white wire, connector (107)/(125), circuits 78-GD2, 78-GD, connector (106), circuits 78-GD,

            <title>Mirrors Heated With Power</title>
            <para>Voltage is present at (J1) junction block, circuit 14P, circuit 14N, fuse block, fuse F34, and circuit
                78L going to power mirror switch (111). When the switch is moved in one direction, current flows through
                switch (111) contacts, circuit 78K, connector (109), circuit 78K, connector (110), the red wire, and
                conn. (113) to power mirror motor. This causes it to move in one direction. The ground path, while the
                switch is in this position, is through connector (113), black wire, conn. (110), circuit 78J, conn.
                (109), circuit 78J, power mirror switch (111), circuits 78-GF, 78-GB, and 78-GA to cab ground.

                mirror motor. This causes it to move in the direction opposite of that explained above. The ground path,
