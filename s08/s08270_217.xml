        <title>Panel Lights</title>
        <para>When the headlight switch (410) is in the parking lights or headlights on position, power is fed through
            the trailer lights switch (409) to energize the trailer tail light relay (464-R9). With the relay energized,
            power flows from battery stud (B2) through circuits 14W and 14B, 30A fuse F3-C,. circuit 68, the NO contacts
            relay (464-R9), circuits 68E and 68B, 15A fuse F8-C, circuits 68C and 62 to panel light switch (416). The
            panel light switch, which is grounded through circuits 11-GS and 11-GLC to L3 ground adapter (505), contains
            an integrated circuit for variable voltage output. This adjustable voltage is applied to circuits 62A, 62S,
            and 62AE to the L1 panel lights adapter (504). The adjustable voltage is also applied to circuits 62A and
            62W going to the panel light in the panel lights switch and to circuits 62A, 62S, and 62M to the L2 panel
            lights adapter (586).
        </para>
        <para>Power from adapter (504) is applied to circuit 62BW and a splice. From the splice power is applied to
            circuit 62T, connector (N/L), and the black wire of the cigar lighter panel light. Power from the splice is
            applied to circuit 62B and the right gauge cluster panel lights connector (72), to circuit 62C and the left
            gauge cluster panel lights (73), to circuit 62D and tachometer panel light (64), to circuit 62E and
            tachometer panel light (63), to circuit 62F and speedometer panel light (68), and to circuit 62G and
            speedometer panel light (67).
        </para>
        <para>The right gauge cluster panel lights (72) are grounded through circuits 11-GW and 11-GD to the left cab
            ground stud (429). The left gauge cluster panel lights (73) are grounded through circuits 11-GV and 11-GF to
            the left cab ground stud (429). Tachometer panel light (64) is grounded through circuits 62-GD and 11-GAC to
            the left cab ground stud (429). Tachometer panel light (63) is grounded through circuits 62-GE and 11-GAC to
            the left cab ground stud (429). Speedometer panel light (68) is grounded through circuits 62-GF and 11-GAC
            to the left cab ground stud (429). Speedometer panel light (67) is grounded through circuits 62-GG and
            11-GAC to the left cab ground stud (429).
        </para>
        <para>Power from L2 panel lights adapter (586) is applied to circuit 62AD and a splice. From the splice power is
            applied to circuit 62AT and the key switch panel light (495). From the splice power is also applied to
            circuit 62P, the heater control panel lamp (84), circuit 62AU, and the fresh air panel light (494).
        </para>
        <para>The key switch light (495) is grounded through circuits 62-GAT and 11-GLB, and L4 panel ground adapter
            (587). The heater control light (84) is grounded through circuits 62-GP and 11-G, and the right cab ground
            (404). The fresh air control panel light (494) is grounded through circuits 62-GAU, 62-GP, and 11-G, and the
            right cab ground (404).
        </para>
        <para>Power from the L1 panel lights feed adapter (504) is applied to circuit 62AX and the push button start
            light (541). This light is grounded through circuit 62GAX and the L3 panel lights ground adapter (505).
