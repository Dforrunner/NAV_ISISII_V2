        <title>Front Park, Turn and Marker Lights - 9800 SFA</title>
        <para>The front park lights receive power through the trailer tail light relay (464-R9), circuits 68E and 68B,
            fuse F8-C, circuits 68C and 54, and connector (N/L). From connector (N/L), power flows through circuit 54,
            connector (N/L), a black wire, connector (N/L), and a brown wire to the left front park light. From
            connector (N/L), power flows through circuit 54A, connector (N/L), a black wire, connector (N/L), and a
            brown wire to the right front park light. The lights are grounded through their mounting hardware.
        </para>
        <para>The left front turn light receives power through the turn signal switch (36), circuit 56E, connector
            (N/L), circuit 56E, a black wire, connector (N/L), and a red wire. The light is grounded through its
            mounting hardware.
        </para>
        <para>The right front turn light receives power through the turn signal switch (36), circuit 57E, connector
            (N/L), circuit 57E, a black wire, connector (N/L), and a red wire. The light is grounded through its
            mounting hardware.
