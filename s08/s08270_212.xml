        <title>Headlights - 9800 SFA</title>
        <para>When the headlight switch (410) is moved to the headlight on position, power from battery stud (B2) flows
            through circuit 14D, 10A circuit breaker F6-C, circuit 50A, the contacts of switch (410), and circuit 50B to
            the headlight relay (462-R4). This energizes the relay that is grounded through circuits 50-GB, 75-GC,
            75-GB, 11-GN, and 11-GB to right cab ground stud (404). With the relay energized, power flows from battery
            stud (B2) through circuit 14D, 20A circuit breaker F6-D, circuit 51, N.O. contacts of (462-R4), and circuit
            51A to dimmer switch (70).
        </para>
        <para>With switch (70) in low beam position, power flows through the switch contacts, circuit 53B, connector
            (423)/(498), and circuit 53B, to the left headlight (2) low beam element, thus causing low beam
            illumination. On vehicles without Canadian DRL, the left headlight is grounded through circuit 11-GL,
            connector (498)/(423), circuit 11-GL, connector (N/L), and circuits 11-GM and 11-GF to left cab ground
            (429). On vehicles with Canadian DRL, the left headlight is grounded through circuit 11-GL, connector
            (498)/(423), circuit 11-GL, connector (N/L), circuit 66J, N.C. contacts of DRL day relay (475) and circuit
            66-GA to G6 ground adapter (616). Power also flows through the switch contacts, circuits 53 and 53A,
            connector (400)/(498), and circuit 53A to the right headlight (2) low beam element, thus causing low beam
            illumination. The right headlight is grounded through circuits 11-GK and 11-G to right cab ground (404).
        </para>
        <para>With switch (70) in high beam position, power flows through the switch contacts, circuit 52C, connector
            (423)/(498), and circuit 52C to the left headlight (2) high beam element, thus causing high beam
            illumination. Power also flows through the switch contacts, circuits 52 and 52B, connector (400)/(498), and
            circuit 52B to the right headlight (2) high beam element, thus causing high beam illumination. See low beam
            illumination operation above for description of ground circuits.
