            <para>The troubleshooting charts in this service section focus on the International harnesses and
                components. The emphasis is determining if the International circuits and components that could cause
                the condition are functioning properly, and steps needed to correct any such conditions.
            </para>
            <para>If International-related circuits and components are determined to be functioning properly, and the
                condition is still present, an authorized Allison dealer should continue the troubleshooting process.
            </para>
            <para>The troubleshooting process includes the following:</para>

                    <para>Use of Troubleshooting Charts to systematically diagnose the various electrical circuits in an
                        efficient manner. It is often as important to know which circuits are functioning correctly as
                        it is to identify a circuit that is not operating correctly. Refer to the Operation description
                        before diagnosing a circuit. Understanding the circuit is key to proper troubleshooting.
                    </para>
                    <para>The troubleshooting charts are designed for the technician to use the Fluke 88 Digital
                        Multimeter. If a TransPro diagnostic tool is available, it can be used for certain general
                        systems tests, but the Fluke 88 is still necessary to isolate the defect to a specific area.

                        probes into the connectors. Use Allison breakout box, part number J 43799, when testing the TCM
                        connectors. Use International breakout box ZTSE-4445 when testing International engine
                        controller connectors. Use jumper wires for testing remaining connectors.

                        attach the meter leads with the alligator clip. For the Allison transmission harness, an Allison
                        Jumper Wiring Kit, part number J39197, is available from authorized Allison dealers.

                <para count="1">The engine and ignition must always be OFF before disconnecting or connecting any
                    harness connectors. When disconnecting a harness connector, the pulling force must be applied to the
                    connector and not pull the connector loose by pulling on the wires.
                </para>
                <para>If vehicle system power is turned on while a harness is disconnected, diagnostic codes will be
                    registered. After a harness is reconnected to the electronic control system, the computer
                    diagnostics should be ignored and cleared from memory.
                </para>
            </step1>
            <step1>
                <para count="1">Inspect all related connectors for damage. They may have damaged pins, loose wires or
                    terminals or may have lost the necessary spring to maintain proper connections.

            <step1>
                <para count="1">If the pins or sockets of the electronic control harness connections are dirty or
                    corroded, they should be cleaned using a good quality, non-residue, non-lubricating cleaning solvent
                    that does not contain petroleum distillates. The solvent should not conduct electricity (will cause
                    shorting between terminals) and should evaporate quickly, eliminating the possibility of
                    condensation within the connectors. ALWAYS remove any excess solvent before assembling a connector
                    to its mating component. Solvents trapped in a connector can damage the connector sealing
                    capabilities.
