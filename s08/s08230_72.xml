            <title>Radiator Shutter With Cummins M11E And N14E</title>
            <para>When the key switch (24) is moved to the ignition or start position, power is applied to circuit 13,
                fuse F2, circuit 23, connector (2) circuit 23F, connector (337) circuit 23F, and connector (340) to the
                engine temperature sensor. The ground path for the engine temperature sensor is through connector (340),
                circuit 23-GC, circuit 23-GG, connector (337), and circuits 23-GG and 11-GU to cab ground.
            </para>
            <para>The engine temperature sensor (340) has a secondary input. It is the A/C high pressure switch (338)
                connected by circuit 23H and ground circuit 23-GE.
            </para>
            <para>Also, the engine temperature sensor (340) provides a 12 volt power feed through circuit 23J to the air
                intake sensor (341) when the A/C high pressure switch (338) and engine temperature sensor (340) are in
                their normal closed states.
            </para>
            <para>The air intake sensor uses that power feed in conjunction with a ground circuit 23-GD, 23-GG,
                connector (337), circuit 23-GG, and 11-GU to cab ground to control an output through connector (341) and
                circuit 23K to shutter solenoid (339). The ground path is circuit 23-GF, 23-GG connector (337), circuit
                23-GG, and 11-GU to cab ground.
            </para>
            <para>The shutters are closed when the shutter solenoid is energized. The shutter solenoid is energized when
                the A/C high pressure switch is closed, when the engine temperature sensor circuit is closed, and the
                air intake sensor circuit is closed.
            </para>
            <para>If one or more of the sensors or switch opens, the shutter solenoid will de-energize, causing the
                radiator shutter to open.
