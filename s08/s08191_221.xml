        <title>Antilock Brake Interface</title>
        <para>If the vehicle is equipped with antilock brakes, information is shared with the ABS controller module over
            the ATA data link. Circuits 98K(-) and 97J(+) from the ABS controller connector to connector (282) and
            terminate at data link negative (515) and data link positive (514).
        </para>
        <para>With the cruise control on/off switch in the on position, power is also applied from the switch to the
            cruise set/resume switch (392) through circuit 97CA. Momentarily depressing the set portion of this switch
            supplies a 12 volt signal to the CEC through circuit 97DH, dash connector (190), and circuit 97DH/97DJ. This
            engages the cruise control and causes the CEC to maintain the current engine RPM. If the cruise control
            speed is already set, depressing the switch in the set position causes the engine RPM to decrease until the
            switch is released.
        </para>
        <para>With the cruise control on/off switch (391) in the on position, depressing the resume/accel portion of the
            set/resume switch (392) supplies a 12 volt signal to the CEC through circuit 97DE, dash connector (190) and
            circuit 97DE/97DK. If the cruise control speed has not been engaged, momentarily depressing the switch
            causes the CEC to resume the last engine RPM setting. If the cruise control is already engaged, momentarily
            depressing the resume/accel portion of the switch will cause the engine RPM and speed to increase in small
            incremental amounts until the desired speed is reached.
        </para>
        <para>The cruise control switches and circuitry are also used for in-cab control of preset, variable, and mobile
            PTO operation applications and required programming of the engine CEC.
