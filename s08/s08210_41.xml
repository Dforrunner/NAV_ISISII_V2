        <title>ELECTRIC WINDOW - RIGHT AND LEFT</title>
        <svcprocinfo>
            <para>The right and left side electric windows are controlled by the driver's right and left side window
                switches. The passenger can also control the Right side window. To operate the windows, the key must be
                in the on or accessory position. The circuit includes the electric window relay (1138), driver's side
                right window switch (1040), driver's side left window switch (1039), passenger's side window switch
                (1041), the right window motor and the left window motor. Power to the three window switches is supplied
                from the B1 battery stud to the common terminal (30) of the window relay (1138). With the key in the on
                or accessory position, the relay is energized applying power to terminal 4 (and internally to terminal
                3) of the driver side right and passenger side window switches (1040) and (1041). The window relay also
                supplies power to the driver side left switch on terminal 28 and internally to terminal 1.

            <title>Right Window Down Operation</title>
            <para>With the passenger's side switch (1041) in the neutral position and the driver's side right window
                switch (1040) in the down position, power from switch terminal 5B is applied to the motor on circuit 83J
                through terminals 6 and 5B of switch (1041) to circuit 83M. Circuit 83L from the motor, through switch
                (1041) terminals 2B and 1, circuit 83K to switch (1040) terminal 2B becomes the ground circuit.

            <para>With the passenger's side switch in the down position, power from terminal 5B is applied to circuit
                83M. Ground is supplied on circuit 83L through switch (1033), circuit 83K, and switch (1040) from
                circuit 83-GB.

                switch (1040) in the up position, power from switch terminal 2B is applied to the motor on circuit 83K
                through terminals 1 and 2B of switch (1041) to circuit 83L. Circuit 83M from the motor, through switch
                (1041) terminals 5B and 6, circuit 83J to switch (1040) terminal 5B becomes the ground circuit.
            </para>
            <para>With the passenger's side switch in the up position power from terminal 2B is applied to circuit 83L.
                Ground is supplied on circuit 83M through switch (1033), circuit 83J, and switch (1040) from circuit
                83-GB.

            <para>With the window switch in the down position, power from switch terminal 4 is applied to the motor on
                circuit 83N. Circuit 83F from the motor to the switch terminal 1 becomes the ground circuit. With the
                switch in the down position, switch terminals 2B and 1 are connected, completing the path to ground.
