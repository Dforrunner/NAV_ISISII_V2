        <title>Testing Hella Relay</title>
        <para>International circuits use suppressed Hella relays for controlling power to load devices. The suppression
            feature (a resistor circuit parallel to the relay coil) prevents voltage spikes from damaging electronic
            components in the vehicle.
            <emph type="bold">These relays must be replaced by approved International parts.</emph>
        </para>
        <para>The part number and relay circuit diagram are embossed on the relay body. The terminals are numbered on
            the relay in the same manner as in the circuit diagrams.
