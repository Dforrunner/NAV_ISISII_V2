        <para>When gauge configurations are changed, or the ESC is replaced, the ESC must be programmed with the "ICAP"
            programming software. The ESC will store the current configuration and update the configuration after
            changes are made. The new configuration will have to be uploaded to International Truck and Engine. This is
            accomplished by dialing in and uploading the updated programming. A copy of the programming is stored at
            International Truck and Engine and updated each time there is a change. This is required in case there is a
            need to download the programming for ESC replacement. Refer to

        <para>The EGC faults, with electronic gauge cluster version 8.7, the diagnostic trouble code will display SPN
            field "1705" and with electronic gauge cluster version 9.3 and later, the diagnostic trouble code will
            display SPN field "2023".
