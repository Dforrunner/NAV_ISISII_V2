        <para>The lighted engine brake on/off switch (434) receives a ground signal on circuits 24-G, 97-GA, connector
            (259), circuits 97-GA, 97-G and 11-G from the negative battery terminal. In the on position, a ground signal
            is sent from the switch on circuit 24AD to engine brake selector switch (433).
        </para>
        <para>When lighted switch (433) is placed in the first position, a ground is applied to circuit 24AE, connector
            (190), and circuit 24AE to the ECM (252). This tells the ECM to enable the brake solenoid for the front
            three cylinders on the M11E engine or the front two and rear two cylinders on the N14E engine when braking
            is called for.
        </para>
        <para>When switch (433) is placed in the second position, a ground is applied to circuit 24AF, connector (190)
            and circuit 24AF to the ECM (252). This tells the ECM to enable the brake solenoid for the rear three
            cylinders on the M11E engine or the center two cylinders on the N14E engine when braking is called for.
        </para>
        <para>When switch (433) is placed in the third position, a ground is applied to circuit 24AF and 24AE to the ECM
            (252). This tells the ECM to enable all solenoids and use all cylinders for braking.
