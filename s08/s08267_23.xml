                dual face lights, power is also supplied to the left lamp (508) by circuit 58H, and the right lamp (509)
                by circuit 58J.

            <title>Stop Light Switch - With Air Brakes</title>
            <para>From the body builder feed stud (J1), power is applied to circuit 14A, fuse D3, and circuit 70 to stop
                light switch connector (79). From the connector, power is supplied to the secondary air system stoplight
                switch on a red wire. From the connector (79), power is also supplied through circuit 70B, connector
                (80) and a red wire to the primary air system stoplight switch. When the brake pedal is applied, power
                flows in parallel through the closed contacts and brown wire of each switch and back to switch connector
                (79) and (80).
            </para>
            <para>When the brake pedal is applied, the primary air system stoplight switch (80) supplies power to the
                body builder connector (194) through circuit 70C and 70E/70A. Power is also supplied to the ECM (379),
                pin 43, through circuit 70C and 70E/97N, bulkhead connector (3) and circuit 97N. At the same time power
                is also applied to circuit 97M, bulkhead connector (3) and circuit 97M to the ECM pin 44 as a redundant
                signal.

            <para>With the brakes applied, the secondary air stoplight switch (79) supplies power to the body builder

                (3) and circuit 97N. As a redundant signal to the ECM, power is also applied to circuit 70C and 97M,

            <title>Stop Light Switch - With Hydraulic Brakes</title>
            <para>From the body builder feed stud (J1), power is applied to circuit 14A, fuse D3, and circuit 70 to stop
                light switch connector (51). When the brake pedal is applied, the closed contacts of the stoplight
                switch supply power to the body builder connector (194) through circuit 70C/70A.
            </para>
            <para>When the brakes are applied power is also supplied to the ECM (379), pin 43, through circuit 70C/97N,
                bulkhead connector (3) and circuit 97N. At the same time, power is supplied to the hydraulic brake
                monitor module (49) through circuit 70C/90R. The monitor module compares this signal to a signal it
                receives from the hydraulic brake switch.
