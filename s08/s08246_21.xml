        <title>BACKUP LIGHT FUNCTION</title>
        <para>The backup light function is controlled by the WTEC III ECU using the backup relay (639) located at the
            rear of the cab with 2000, 4000, 8000 and on the platform with 3600, 3800 and 4000FBC. When the transmission
            is in reverse and the key switch (24) is in the ignition position, power from fuse F1 flows through circuit
            71, connector (2), circuit 71, connector (304), circuit 71, connector (631), and circuit 72 to the backup
            relay (639) at terminal 30. Ignition power from fuse 301 is applied to the backup relay at terminal 85 by
            way of circuit 146, connector (418) and circuit 146.
        </para>
        <para>When the WTEC III ECU determines the transmission is in REVERSE, the ECU applies a ground to circuit 113
            going to the backup relay (terminal 86), causing the backup relay to energize. With the relay energized,
            power from fuse F1 (present at backup relay terminal 30) flows through the relay and out terminal 87 through
            circuit 71A, connector (631), circuit 71A, connector (304), circuit 71A, connector (2), and circuit 71B/71A
            to connector (13).
        </para>
        <para>To summarize the backup light system: whenever the ignition switch is on, ignition power is supplied to
            backup relay terminal 85, and to back up relay terminal 30. With the transmission in reverse, the WTEC III
            ECU applies a ground causing the backup relay to energize and power is supplied from the backup relay
            terminal 87 to the rear cab connector (13).
