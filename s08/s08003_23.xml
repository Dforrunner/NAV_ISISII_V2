                <para count="1">With the two-speed switch in the HI position, SF-1 relay is not energized and power from
                    F14 fuse passes through the SF-1 relay terminal 30 to terminal 87 and to the two-speed motor at the
                    "A" connector (see circuit diagram). This causes the axle to shift to the high mode.
