        <para>When the left luggage compartment switch is closed, power flows from battery stud B2 through circuit 14AK,
            14AP, fuse F8 - D, circuit 63AA, 63AB, and 63AJ to the left luggage compartment light switch. Then power
            flows through circuit 63AK, and 63AL to the left lamp. If the right luggage compartment light switch is also
            closed, power will also flow through 63AB, 63AC, and 63AD to the right luggage compartment light switch.
            Then power flows through circuit 63AE and 63AH to the right lamp. The ground path for the left light is 63 -
            GAK, 11 - GAF, 11 - GBC, 11 - GBD, and 11 - GBE to ground adapter (454). The ground path for the right light
            is 63 - GD, 11 - GAG, 11 - GBC, 11 - GBD, and 11 - GBE to ground adapter(454).
