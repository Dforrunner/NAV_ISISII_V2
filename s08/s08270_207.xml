        <title>Cab, Dome, Reading, Courtesy Lights</title>
        <para>Power from the (B2) battery stud is applied to circuits 14W and 14T, 10A fuse F2-B, circuit 63AC,
            connector (19), circuits 63C and 63S, connector (559), and circuit 63 to a splice. From the splice power is
            applied to circuit 63C and the left dome light connector (571), and circuit 63A and the right dome light
            connector (570).
        </para>
        <para>When the dome light switch (439) is moved to the on position, a ground path is provided by the L4 panel
            ground adapter (587), circuits 11-GLB and 63-G, dome light switch (439), circuit 63AD, connector (19),
            circuit 63D, connector (559), and circuit 63B to a splice. From the splice, the left dome light (571) is
            grounded through circuit 63D, and the right dome light (570) is grounded through circuit 63E, thus causing
            them to illuminate.
        </para>
        <para>Power from the (B2) battery stud is also applied to circuits 14W and 14T, 10A fuse F2-B, circuit 63AC,
            connector (19), and circuit 63C to a splice. From the splice power is applied to circuit 63R and the left
            reading light connector (569), and circuit 63T and the right reading light connector (568).
        </para>
        <para>When the switch on a reading light is moved to the on position, the light will illuminate. The ground path
            for the left reading light is through connector (569), and circuits 63GR and 11-GAA to roof strainer ground
            (J3). The ground for the right reading light is through connector (568), and circuits 63-GT and 11-GAA to
            roof strainer ground (J3).
        </para>
        <para>Likewise power from the (B2) battery stud is applied to circuits 14W and 14T, 10A fuse F2-B, circuit 63AC,
            connector (19), circuit 63C, connector (437), and circuit 63V to the left courtesy light (207). Power from
            10A fuse F2-B is also applied to circuit 63V, connec- tor (403), and circuit 63V to the right courtesy light
            (207). When the dome light switch (439) is moved to the on position, a ground path is provided by the L4
            panel ground adapter (587), circuits 11-GLB and 63-G, dome light switch (439), circuit 63AD, connector (19),
            circuit 63D, connector (437), and circuit 63H to the left courtesy light (207). A ground path is also
            provided by switch (439) to circuit 63H, connector (403), and circuit 63H to the right courtesy light (207),
            thus causing the courtesy lights to illuminate.
        </para>
        <para>When the dome light switch (439) is set in the automatic position, the dome lights and courtesy lights
            will be automatically turned on when either the left or right door is opened. This is accomplished by the
            left door switch and circuit 63J, or the right door switch and circuit 63K, in conjunction with the ground
            circuits leading from the dome light switch to the lights.
