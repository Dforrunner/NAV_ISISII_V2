        <para>Whenever electric welding is done on any part of the vehicle, it is not necessary to disconnect the
            International electronic modules in the cab such as the BC, RPM, and the instrument cluster. The welder's
            GND must be connected as close to the weld as possible. If the vehicle is equipped with an International
            engine, disconnect both the positive (+) and the negative (-) battery cables including the electronic power
            feeds prior to electric welding. If it is necessary to weld close to an electronic component, it is
            recommended that the component be temporarily removed.
        </para>
        <para>Consult manufacturer's instructions for all other electronic modules such as Allison Transmission, Eaton
            Auto Shift Transmission, Bendix ABS, Wabco ABS, Cummins Engine, Caterpillar Engine, and Detroit Diesel
            Engine.
