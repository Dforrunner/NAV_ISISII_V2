            <title>ECM Power Circuits</title>
            <para>With the key switch on, the ECM receives (12 volt DC) operating power from the vehicle batteries
                through International engine harness connector (1014) terminal 70. The battery power to the ECM is
                switched on or off by the run relay (64), which is energized when the key switch (24) is in the ignition
                position.

                    <para>Turning the key switch (24) on applies power through circuits 13A, 13B, 97A, connector (332)
                        and the control coil of the run relay (64), causing it to energize. The relay control coil is
                        grounded through circuit 11-DB going to cab ground.

                    <para>Battery power from connector (332) battery adapter is applied to run relay (64) terminal 30.
                        This circuit is protected by 5A fuse F11-B. With the relay energized, battery voltage passes
                        through the Normally Open (NO) relay contacts and is sent on circuit 97L to International ECM
                        connector (1014) terminal 70.

            <para>Battery power from the (+) battery terminal of the cranking motor solenoid is always applied on
                circuits 97 and 97A through circuits 97B and 97C, connector (1014) terminals 52 and 53 to the ECM. These
                circuits are protected by 20A fuses (217) and (218).

            <para>The ECM uses this power to maintain a portion of memory used for customer trip data accumulators.
