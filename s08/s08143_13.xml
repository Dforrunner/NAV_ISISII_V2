        <title>TESTING HELLA RELAY</title>
        <para>To test the relay, use the following steps:</para>
        <step1>
            <para count="1">With the relay removed, measure the resistance between relay terminals 85 and 86 (coil
                resistance). The resistance should be approximately 72 ohms.
            </para>
            <step2>
                <para count="1">If the resistance is correct, go to step 2.</para>
            </step2>
            <step2>
                <para count="1">If the resistance is not correct, replace the relay.</para>
            </step2>
        </step1>
        <step1>
            <para count="1">Measure resistance between terminals 30 and 87a. The resistance should be less than 1.0
                ohm.
            </para>
            <step2>
                <para count="1">If resistance is less than 1.0 ohm, go to step 3.</para>
            </step2>
            <step2>
                <para count="1">If resistance is not less than 1.0 ohm, replace the relay.</para>
            </step2>
        </step1>
        <step1>
            <para count="1">Use 12V battery source and test leads and apply 12V across terminals 85 and 86. (The relay
                should make an audible click.) Use ohmmeter and measure resistance between terminals 30 and 87 with
                relay energized. Resistance should be 1.0 ohm or less.
            </para>
            <step2>
                <para count="1">If continuity is present across terminals 30 to 87, go to step 4.</para>
            </step2>
            <step2>
                <para count="1">If continuity is not present, replace the relay.</para>
            </step2>

        <step1>
            <para count="1">With the relay energized (from step 3), measure resistance across terminals 30 to 87a. The
                circuit resistance should be 100K ohms or more (no continuity).
            </para>
            <step2>
                <para count="1">If continuity is not present, the relay tests good.</para>
