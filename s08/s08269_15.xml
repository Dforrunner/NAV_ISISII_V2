            <title>Transmission Oil Temperature Gauge</title>
            <para>The transmission oil temperature gauge is powered whenever the key switch is on, through circuits 13,
                13F, fuse F22, circuit 28 and 28A, the yellow cluster connector (10), and the cluster printed circuit
                board. The gauge is grounded through the printed circuit board, the yellow connector (10), circuits
                28-GA, 11-GB, and 11-G to the (J1) platform ground.
            </para>
            <para>Current flows from the temperature gauge to the variable resistor transmission oil temperature sender
                (38) through the printed circuit board, yellow connector (10), circuit 31, dash connector (2 and 2A),
                and circuit 31. The sender ground is through 31-G and 11-GJ to the (J10) engine ground.
            </para>
            <para>As oil temperature increases, the resistance of the sensor (38) will decrease. This allows more
                current to flow through the gauge coil and causes the gauge to read higher.

                circuit 28 and 28B, the green cluster connector (11), and the cluster printed circuit board. The gauge
                is grounded through the printed circuit board, the green connector (11), circuits 28-G, 11-GB, and 11-G
                to the (J1) platform ground.

            <para>Current flows from the fuel level gauge to the fuel sender (37) through the printed circuit board,
                green connector (11), circuit 36, dash connector (2 and 2A), and circuit 36. The sender ground is

        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Hydraulic Brake Low Fluid and Parking Brake Warning System</title>
            <para>When the key switch (20) is turned to the on position, power is supplied to the low brake fluid
                warning system through circuit 28A, to a splice, circuit 90R, the low level fluid warning light (89),
                circuit 90V, to a splice, circuit 90P, connector (84), circuit 90P, connector (88), and circuit 90P to
                the normally open sensor switch (90). When a low brake fluid level is encountered, the sensor switch
                closes and the circuit is ground through the switch, circuits 11-GF and 11-GE to the platform ground.
            </para>
            <para>When the key switch is turned to the start position, a momentary ground is applied through the key
                switch, circuit 90X, diode connector assembly (82) and circuit 90W to the previously mentioned splice.
                This causes the warning light to come on as a bulb check and go off when the key is released from the
                start position.
            </para>
            <para>Power is also applied to the parking brake warning system through the cluster warning lamp feed
                (10-1), circuit 28A, circuit 28C, connector (12-8), to the warning light, connector (12-17), circuit
                44A, connector (2), circuit 44A and circuit 44B to the normally open parking brake switch (N/L). When
                parking brake is applied, the switch contacts close and complete the circuit through the switch and
                circuits 44-G and 11GD to starter motor ground.
            </para>
            <para>When the key is turned to the start position, a ground is applied to the circuitry through the
                ignition switch, circuits 4B and 44, connector (2), and circuit 44 to circuit 44B at the park brake
                switch. This causes the warning light to come on as a bulb check and go off when the key is released
                from the start position.
            </para>

        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Low Air Pressure Warning System</title>
            <para>When the key switch (20) is turned on, power is applied to circuit 13/13F, fuse F22, circuit 28/28A,
                connector (10), the instrument cluster printed circuit board, the brake warning light, the circuit
                board, connector (10), circuit 40A, and to the fast mode side of alarm (211).
            </para>
            <para>When the vehicle is started and the air pressure is below 60 psi, the air pressure switch (717) is
                closed and provides a ground path for the alarm and warning light through circuit 40, connector (2),
                circuit 40, and through the closed air pressure switch (717) which is grounded through its mounting.
