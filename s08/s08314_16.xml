        <title>ODOMETER</title>
        <para>The electronic odometer system consists of a dash mounted, solenoid activated, mechanical counter and
            microprocessor. The microprocessor's internal counter advances the odometer 1/10 mile after counting the
            appropriate distance based on vehicle speed sensor information. In addition, the microprocessor's internal
            counter advances 1/20 mile every time the ignition is turned on to minimize odometer error by replacing the
            accumulated mileage that is less than 1/10 mile (lost when key switch is turned off) with an average value
            of 1/2 of 1/10 mile or 1/20 mile. This provides for a very accurate odometer.

            <note>
                <para>Tire revolutions per mile are the greatest variable in determining speedometer accuracy. Factors
                    which can affect tire revolutions per mile are tire manufacturing tolerances, tire load, tire
                    pressure, vehicle speed and tire wear.
