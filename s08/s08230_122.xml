        <title>Engine Brake Switches</title>
        <para>The engine brake on/off switch (170) receives a ground signal on circuit 24-G, through connector (3) on
            circuit 97-GA from (1091). In the on position, a ground signal is sent from the switch on circuit 24AD to
            engine brake selector switch (171).
        </para>
        <para>When engine brake selector switch (171) is placed in the first position, a ground is applied to circuit
            24AE, connector (3), and circuit 24AE to the ECM (1091). This tells the ECM to enable the brake solenoid for
            the front three cylinders on the ISM engine when braking is called for.
        </para>
        <para>When switch (171) is placed in the second position, a ground is applied to circuit 24AF, through connector
            (3) to ECM (1091). This tells the ECM to enable the brake solenoid for the rear three cylinders on the ISM
            engine when braking is called for.
        </para>
        <para>When switch (171) is placed in the third position, a ground is placed on circuit 24E. Ground is also
            placed on circuit 24AFT, through connector (3) to the ECM (1091). This tells the ECM to enable the brake
            solenoids for all cylinders on the ISM engine when braking is called for.
