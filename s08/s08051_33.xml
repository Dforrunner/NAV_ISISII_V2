        <title>Electric Windshield Wipers - Intermittent Wipe &#38; Wash</title>
        <para>
            <title>Wiper Operation</title>Refer to ELECTRIC WINDSHIELD WIPER WITH INTERMITTENT WIPE AND WASH circuit
            diagram in CTS-5119S. With the key ON or OFF, battery power is always present at the common terminal (30) of
            Wiper Intermittent Relay (142). When the key is ON, the relay is energized and supplies power from the
            normally open terminal (87) for all wiper and washer operations. Power is applied to the wiper switch (431)
            at terminal 5.
        </para>
        <para>
            <emph type="bold">Low Speed Wiper Operation-</emph>With the wiper switch in the position, power from
            terminal 5 is applied internally to terminal 2, then through circuit 82E to the low speed winding in the
            wiper motor.
        </para>
        <para>
            <emph type="bold">High Speed Wiper Operation-</emph>With the wiper switch in the High position, power from
            terminal 5 is applied internally to terminal 6, then through circuit 82D to the high speed winding in the
            wiper motor. Note that power from 5 is not applied to terminals 3 and 4 in the high speed position, so power
            is not applied to the low speed winding.
        </para>
        <para>
            <emph type="bold">Park Operation -</emph>Note that power is always present (with key ON) at P terminal of
            crank motor. When the wipers are operating, the circuit between wiper motor P and S is closed. In this
            position, power from P goes through S, through the normally closed contacts of the wiper relay (143) and
            back to the wiper switch at terminal 1. From terminal 1, the power goes through terminal 2 to the low speed
            winding and the motor continues to operate until the park switch rotates, closing the circuit between S and
            X, parking the wipers and turning off operation.
        </para>
        <para>
            <title>Intermittent Wiper And Washer Operation</title>The intermittent wiper and washer switches are part of
            switch assembly (432).
        </para>
        <para>
            <emph type="bold">Intermittent Wiper Operation -</emph>With ignition key ON, depressing the intermittent
            switch (A) applies power from switch terminal C through circuit 82J to energize the wiper motor relay (shown
            de-energized). With the wiper motor relay energized, power from the energized wiper motor intermittent relay
            (142) passes through the wiper motor relay (143) and through circuit 82H to the wiper motor switch at
            terminal 1. With the wiper switch in the position (shown in diagram), the power passes through the switch
            (terminal 1 to 2) and is applied through circuit 82E to the low speed motor winding.
        </para>
        <para>When the intermittent switch is released, wiper motor relay (143) de-energizes, turning off power to the
            wiper switch, and the wiper motor operates until it reaches the park position.
        </para>
        <para>
            <emph type="bold">Windshield Washer Operation -</emph>Depressing the washer switch (E), which is part of
            switch (432), energizes the windshield washer pump and energizes the wiper motor relay (143) which causes
            the wipers to operate in the intermittent mode.
