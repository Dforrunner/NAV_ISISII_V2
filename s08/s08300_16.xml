        <title>J1939 HIGH SPEED DATA LINK CABLE (SAE J1939/15) - Beginning January 2002</title>
        <svcprocinfo>
            <para>The information in this section applies to all 3200, 4200, 4300, 4400, and 7000 models.</para>
            <para>Performing the proper repairs or modifications of the cable is critical to the integrity and
                performance of the vehicle systems. (For repair procedure see Electrical Troubleshooting Guide - S08250
                or Data Link Repair in this manual.) This information based on SAE J1939/15 and TMC RP 142.
            </para>
            <para>These instructions are intended for modifications that meet the SAE spec; i.e., no internal resistor.
                When extending the backbone the proper materials must be used. The data link cable consists of a twisted
                pair of insulated wires and are covered by an insulating jacket. The data link cable must meet the SAE -
                specified characteristic impedance of 120 ohms. Never splice regular automotive type wire such as GXL,
                SXL, TXL into the data link cable. Use data link cable furnished by Raychem, part number 2021D0309.
            </para>
            <para>The backbone is the main part of the cable. This is terminated at each end with a 120 ohm resistor.
                When adding a device the backbone must be extended. This is done by removing the resistor, inserting the
                backbone extension, then plugging the resistor and the device into the extension.
            </para>
            <para>The International&#174; high performance vehicle will always have a power train J1939 system. This is
                for key operations that come from the factory direct. A second J1939 system is put in place for body
                builders and will be referred to as body builder J1939. Circuit diagrams are shown in chapter 9 of the
                Circuit Diagram Book (S08250) under Remote Power Units, Solenoid Packs, Remote Engine Speed Controller.
            </para>

            <title>J1939</title>
            <para>J1939 is a high speed serial communications data link. The system requires two resistor caps. the
                first resistor cap for body builder J1939 currently starts in the engine compartment. the second
                resistor cap ends where the last module is placed. the wire between these two resistors is called the
                backbone. The backbone cannot be longer than 131.2 feet (40m). A module can tap into the backbone. This
                point is called the Node. The distance between two nodes can not be less than 3.9 inches (0.1m). The
                cable length from the node to the module cannot be longer than 9.8 feet (3m).
            </para>
            <para>With the research of the robustness of the J1939-15 lite (unshielded) International removed the shield
                from their high performance vehicle in January 2002. Mixing of the shielded (J1939-11) and unshielded
                (J1939-15) is not recommended.

            <para>Most of the software information is processed in the Electronic System Controller (ESC). Therefore the
                J1939 wires must be connected to the ESC. The Green wire, that contains a circuit number 5 and (-) in
                diagram books, is connected to ESC gray connector 4004 pin 35. The Yellow wire, also known as circuit
                number 5 (+) in the circuit diagram books, is connected to ESC Gray connector 4004 pin 34. Insert Red
                wire in the fuse block into cavity F2-F3. the power wire J14M in F2-E3 should already be there. Add a 5
                amp fuse between F2-F3 and F2-E3. Ground wire J11-GQR needs to go onto the ground stud labeled 4005 in
                the diagram book located near Power Distribution Center (PDC).

                <caution>
                    <para>While working on connector 4004 a strap lock will be removed. Failure to replace this will
                        cause premature connector and wiring failure.

                </caution>
            </specpara>
            <para>Continue to route with current dash harness to center chassis harness. This will route under the PDC
                and end at center chassis connection located near the PDC. It may be easier to follow the center chassis
                harness from under the cab and see where it connects to the dash harness in engine compartment. After
                installing the 6 way connector, refer to the circuit diagram book connector 4410.

            <title>Vehicles Equipped with Body Builder J1939 Data Link</title>
            <para>You have either added the body builder J1939 or it is already there in the dash (engine compartment).
                You need to decide what needs to be added to the chassis section.
            </para>
            <para>The body builder data link is located under the hood near the steering shaft assembly, just below the
                PDC. Depending upon the level of sophistication desired, adding the components listed below can be
                performed by simply removing the terminating resistor cap located near the PDC and then adding the
                additional harness to extend the J1939 body builder data link. Complete the installation by connecting
                additional International designed Remote Power Modules (RPM) or remote Air Solenoid Modules.
