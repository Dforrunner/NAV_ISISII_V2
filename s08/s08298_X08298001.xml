            <item>
                <para>Before beginning these test procedures, make sure the vehicle batteries are at 75% state of charge
                    (SOC) or higher. This represents an open circuit voltage (OCV) of 12.4 volts. Batteries with an OCV
                    of 12 volts or less are either completely discharged or have a dead cell.
                </para>
            </item>
            <item>
                <para>Before beginning these test procedures, check any light or indicator lamp filaments that are
                    suspected of being open (burned out). This is done to avoid unnecessary extensive circuit checks.
                </para>
            </item>
            <item>
                <para>Before beginning these test procedures, inspect all connectors for loose or damaged pins, wires,
                    etc. Refer to TEST EQUIPMENT AND CONNECTOR REPAIR section in Group 08 Electrical in the Master
                    Service Manual.
                </para>
            </item>
            <item>
                <para>When the mechanic determines that a fuse is blown, while checking its condition, he is directed to
                    locate the cause of the overload condition and to repair it. While no further instruction on this
                    procedure is listed in the diagnostic tables, the common procedure is as follows: isolate sections
                    of the circuit by disconnecting connectors, and measure the resistance to ground to find the circuit
                    that is shorted to ground. Then locate the damaged spot in the wire or connector and repair.
                </para>
            </item>
            <item>
                <para>Diagnostics for circuits that are malfunctioning by sticking in the on position are generally not
                    covered in detail. It is assumed that the mechanic knows to check for a malfunctioning switch,
                    relay, or solenoid.
