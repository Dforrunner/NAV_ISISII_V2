        <para>
            <emph type="bold">Engine Brake On/Off Switch (246) -</emph>The Engine Brake On/Off Switch is a 2-pole,
            single-throw switch. One pole receives a signal from the ECM on circuit 24R(5V), and when the switch is
            closed (ON position), that pole is grounded to the ECM (terminal 5).
        </para>
        <para>The other pole of the Engine Brake On/Off Switch receives 12 volt ignition power from J1 Ignition
            connector (circuit 24AC). This is the power to activate the engine brake solenoids when the Engine Brake
            Enable Relay is activated.

        <para>
            <emph type="bold">Engine Brake Enable Relay (248) -</emph>
            The Engine Brake Enable Relay acts as a switch that is controlled by the ECM to allow ignition power to be
            delivered through the Engine Brake Selector switch to energize the engine brake solenoids. A signal from the
            ECM (circuit 24AA) to the control coil of the relay will activate it, closing the circuit between contacts
            30 and 87 in the relay. With the relay activated, ignition current flows to the Engine Brake Selector
            Switch.
        </para>
        <para>
            <emph type="bold">Engine Brake Selector Switch (247) -</emph>With Engine Brake Enable Relay activated,
            ignition power is delivered through the 9-way ECM connector to the engine brake solenoids. The power does
            not go through the ECM.
