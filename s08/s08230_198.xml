        <title>Non-Electronic Allison Automatic Transmission With International Engine</title>
        <para>When key switch (24) is moved to the start or ignition position, power is fed to fuse F1, circuit 92D,
            connector (2), circuit 92D, connector (402), circuit 92D/92E to the modulator solenoid relay (403) coil.
            Power is also fed from connector (402), circuit 92D/92B to the modulator solenoid relay (403) contacts.
        </para>
        <para>The modulator solenoid relay (403) is energized when ECM (379) applies a ground to circuit 92F, connector
            (402), and circuit 92F.
        </para>
        <para>When the ECM commands a transmission shift, the relay coil ground is removed by the ECM which de-energizes
            the relay. With the modulator solenoid relay de-energized, power flows through circuit 92C, connector (402),
            circuit 92C, connector (389), and circuit 92C to the modulator shift solenoid (404). This causes the shift
            to occur.
        </para>
        <para>The ground path for the modulator shift solenoid is circuit 92-G, connector (389), circuit 92-G/11-GJ to
            starting motor ground.
        </para>
        <para>When the key switch (24) is moved to the start or ignition position, power is also applied to circuit
            13A/13B, fuse F17, circuit 97P, connector (2), circuit 97P, and connector (438) to the neutral position
            switch. If the transmission is in neutral, power flows through the switch, connector (438), circuit 97AU,
            connector (2), and circuit 97AU to the crank inhibit relay (661) system.
