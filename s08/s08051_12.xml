        <svcprocinfo>
            <para>Refer to 12V POWER DISTRIBUTION - 3 + 1 BATTERY SYSTEM circuit diagram, in CTS-5119S for the following
                discussion. The 3+1 battery system includes three cranking batteries and one deep cycle battery. The
                purpose of this system is to prevent discharging the three cranking batteries while operating certain
                electrical accessories connected to B2, off the fourth battery, when the engine is not running.

            <para>With the engine running power (7 volts) from the alternator R terminal energizes the isolated battery
                magnetic switch closing the contacts. This links the positive terminal of the deep cycle and cranking
                motor batteries, recharging all four batteries and supplying power from all four batteries to both the
                B1 and B2 battery studs.

            <para>The three cranking batteries supply power to the B1 battery stud. Refer to 12V POWER DISTRIBUTION -
                BATTERY circuit diagram, in CTS-5119S for components receiving power from the B1 stud with the key OFF.
            </para>
            <para>If the key switch is in the ON or ACC position with the engine OFF, refer to 12V POWER DISTRIBUTION -
                ACCESSORY and 12V POWER DISTRIBUTION - IGNITION in CTS-5119S for power distribution.
