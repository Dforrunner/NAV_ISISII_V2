        <step1>
            <para count="1">When the key switch is moved to the ignition (ON) or start position and the engine is not
                running, the pump motor will run, and the warning light and alarm will activate. The pump motor will run
                because the flow switch will be closed, a ground will be provided to the hydraulic brake relay (300) by
                circuits 90J, 90K, and 90L, the brake relay will energize, and power will be fed to the pump motor by
                circuit 90N. When power is applied to the pump motor, the monitor will see a voltage on circuit 90P at
                pin F. Thus the module activates the warning light and alarm by placing a ground at pin C on circuit 90S
                going to the alarm (R1).

        <step1>
            <para count="1">When the key switch is moved to the ignition (ON) or start position (engine not running),
                the warning light and alarm will activate if power is not present at the hydraulic pump motor. The
                module (49) monitors for this voltage through pin F and circuit 90P, thus signaling a problem with the
                hydraulic brake relay (300), pump motor supply circuits 90, 90A, or 90N, flow switch circuits 90L, 90K,
                or 90J, or a flow switch that is not closed ("grounded") at this time.

        <step1>
            <para count="1">With the engine running, the power steering pump will supply a flow of fluid to the
                Hydro-Max and open up the flow switch. If the flow switch fails to open, due to lack of flow or a faulty
                switch, a ground path will be provided by the flow switch and circuits 90J, 90K, and 90L to the
                hydraulic brake relay (300). Thus the relay will energize, apply power to circuit 90N and the motor, and
                circuit 90P to pin F of the monitor module (49). Thus the warning light and alarm will remain activated,
                and the pump motor will run.

        </step1>
        <step1>
            <para count="1">Likewise, if the engine is running and the flow switch closes due to loss of power steering
                fluid flow, the warning light and alarm will activate, and the pump motor will run.

        </step1>
        <step1>
            <para count="1">When the engine is running, the flow switch is open, and the pressure differential switch
                (301) is open, the hydraulic brake relay (300) will de-energize. The monitor module (49) will check the
                continuity of the Hydro-Max pump motor's brushes and windings by way of pin F and circuit 90P, and will
                then activate the warning light and alarm, if continuity is not present.

            <para count="1">When the engine is running, the flow switch is open, and the pressure differential switch
                (301) is open, the hydraulic brake relay (300) will de-energize. The monitor module (49) will check the
                output of hydraulic brake relay (300) by way of pin F and circuits 90P and 90N, and will then activate
                the warning light and alarm if the normally open (N.O.) contacts of relay (300) remain closed (weld
                themselves together). This condition will cause the pump to run all of the time.

        <step1>
            <para count="1">When the key switch is in the ignition (ON) and the engine is running, the warning light and
                alarm will activate if the differential pressure switch (301) closes. The switch will close when a
                substantial pressure difference is sensed between the front and rear sections of the master cylinder.
                The pressure switch (301) is connected to the hydraulic brake relay (300) by way of circuits 90J and
                90K, and when the switch contacts close, the hydraulic brake relay (300) will energize. Thus the relay
                will apply power to circuit 90N and the motor, and circuit 90P to pin F of the monitor module (49).
            </para>
            <para>Thus the warning light and alarm will remain activated, and the pump motor will run.</para>
        </step1>
        <step1>
            <para count="1">When the brake pedal is depressed, the hydraulic brake switch (50) allows power to be
                applied to circuit 90D, blocking diode (48), and circuit 90F to pin E of the monitor module (49). Also,
                when the brake pedal is depressed, stop light switch (51) allows power to be applied to circuit 90R to
                pin H of the monitor module. The monitor module (49) compares the output of these two switches at pin G
                and pin H. If the module sees a voltage at only one of these pins for a time period of 14&#177;5
                seconds, the warning light and alarm will activate and latch ON (can only be turned off by cycling key
                switch off and back on). This check is to detect defective switches and circuitry. Note that a time
                delay is built in to prevent false alarms caused by a vibrating pedal or a foot resting against and
                slightly jarring the pedal.
