        <para>The bunk fluorescent light is a fluorescent light and switch assembly mounted at the headliner to provide
            the main source of illumination in the sleeper. An additional light switch is located in the control panel
            where it is more accessible. The reading light is located at the control panel for the sleeper bunk to
            provide illumination for reading when the fluorescent light is off, or when additional light is needed. The
            cigar lighter is located in the control panel to be used for lighting cigars or powering accessories. Single
            or dual spotlights are also available, have on/off switches mounted on their handles, and are controlled
            from inside the sleeper.
