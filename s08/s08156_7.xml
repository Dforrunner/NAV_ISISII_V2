        <para>When key switch (452) is moved to the ignition position, power is applied to I1 ignition adapter (518),
            circuit 13AT, and the coil of auxiliary blower relay (441). The ground path for the auxiliary blower relay
            is circuits 13-GAT, 75-GH, 75-GN, and 11-GBB to right cab ground stud (404). This energizes the auxiliary
            bunk blower relay (441) and allows power to flow from (B2) battery stud through circuit 14AU, 15A fuse F10-B
            [location may vary], circuit 75AX, aux. bunk relay (441) N.O. contacts, circuit 75AS, connector (80),
            circuits 75AS and 75AR to bunk heater blower switch (550).
        </para>
        <para>When the bunk heater blower switch (550) is moved to the low speed position, power flows through circuit
            75AC, connector (80), circuit 75AC, connector (51), circuit 75AC, resistor and thermo fuse assembly, circuit
            75AT, connector (48), circuit 75AT, sleeper high speed relay (481) N.C. contacts, circuit 75AF, connector
            (48), and circuit 75AF to the sleeper blower motor.
        </para>
        <para>This causes the blower motor to run at low speed. The blower motor ground path is circuit 75-GA, connector
            (48), circuit 75-GA and 11-GBB to right cab ground stud (404).
        </para>
        <para>When the bunk blower switch (550) is moved to the medium speed position, power flows through circuit 75AN,
            connector (80), and circuit 75AN to the sleeper medium speed relay (480). The ground path for the sleeper
            medium speed relay (480) is circuits 75-GN and 11-GBB to right cab ground stud (404). This energizes the
            sleeper medium speed relay (480) and allows power to flow from (B2) battery stud through circuit 14AU, fuse
            F10-A, circuits 75AW, 75AB, sleeper medium speed relay (480) N.O. contacts, circuit 75AM, connector (48),
            circuit 75AM, resistor and thermo fuse assembly (41), circuit 75AT, connector (48), circuit 75AT, sleeper
            high speed relay (481) N.C. contacts, circuit 75AF, connector (48), and circuit 75AF to sleeper blower
            motor. This causes the blower motor to run at medium speed. The blower ground path is circuit 75-GA,
            connector (48), circuits 75-GA and 11-GBB to right cab ground stud (404).
        </para>
        <para>When the bunk blower switch (550) is moved to the high speed position, power flows through the switch,
            circuit 75AH, connector (80), and circuit 75AH to the sleeper high speed relay (481). The ground path for
            the sleeper high speed relay (481) is circuits 75-GH, 75-GN, and 11-GBB to right cab ground stud (404).
        </para>
        <para>This energizes the sleeper high speed relay (481) and allows power to flow from (B2) battery stud through
            circuit 14AU, 30A fuse F10-A [location may vary], circuits 75AW, 75AD, sleeper high speed relay (481) N.O.
            contacts, circuit 75AF, connector (48), and circuit 75AF to sleeper blower motor. This causes the blower
            motor to run at high speed.
        </para>
        <para>The blower ground path is circuit 75-GA, connector (48), circuits 75-GA and 11-GBB to right cab ground
            stud (404).
        </para>
        <para>When the key switch (452) is moved to the ignition position, power is also made available by the auxiliary
            bunk relay (441) to circuit 75AS, connector (80), circuits 75AS and 75AL, connector (552), and circuit 75BA
            to A/C micro relay (1001). When the sleeper blower switch (550) is in the off position, the A/C micro relay
            is de-energized and power will flow through its N.C. contacts. From the contacts, power will flow through
            circuit 75BC, connector (592F)/(552M), circuit 75K, connector (80), circuit 75K, connector (45), and circuit
            75K to the damper door motor flat pack. This will close the sleeper damper door and prevent heated air from
            being drawn from the sleeper into the cab, which may be set for a cooler temperature.
        </para>
        <para>When the sleeper blower switch (550) is set to low, medium, or high position, the A/C micro relay (1001)
            will energize. This will return control of the sleeper damper door to the sleeper temperature control
            (552F).
        </para>
        <para>Thus from the A/C micro relay (1001), power flows through circuit 75BB to sleeper temperature control
            connector (1002)/(552F). The ground path for the sleeper temperature control is through connector
            (552F)/(1002), circuit 75-GS, connector (592F)/(552M), circuits 75-GS, 11-GBJ, 11-GAN, connector (81),
            circuits 11-GAN and 11-GBB to right cab ground stud (404).
        </para>
        <para>As above, power is also made available by the auxiliary bunk relay (441) to circuit 75L, connector (45),
            and circuit 75L to the heater box damper flat pack. The heater box damper flat pack is grounded through
            circuit 75-GL, connector (44), circuits 75-G and 11-G to right cab ground stud (404). The flat pack receives
            a variable voltage from the sleeper temperature control through connector (552F), circuits 75BD and 75BC,
            connector (552M)/(592F), circuit 75K, connector (80), circuit 75K, connector (45), and circuit 75K. Thus the
            damper blends hot and cold air as selected by the sleeper temperature control.
        </para>
        <para>When cooling is required in the sleeper and the cab A/C switch is not in the on position, the cab switch
            must be moved to the on position by the driver or sleeper occupant. Thus the A/C compressor will engage (the
            compressor will cycle with the thermostatic switch), and cooling will be available for the sleeper blower.
