        <svcprocinfo>
            <para>The cruise control switches are used as PTO controls (if vehicle is so equipped) when the vehicle road
                speed is not present (this is an owner selected parameter). Refer to the Owners Manuals furnished with
                the vehicle for operating instructions.

            <title>Cruise Control ON/OFF Switch (274)</title>
            <para>The cruise ON/OFF switch circuit (97AE) is an input to the ECM through OEM connector (263) terminal
                #10. The ground side of the ON/OFF switch is connected through circuit 97-GH to OEM connector (263)
                terminal #2 (GRD). With the switch ON, the ECM sees 0 volts at OEM connector (263) terminal #10. With
                the switch OFF, the ECM sees 5 volts at OEM connector (263) terminal #10.

            <title>Cruise Set/Resume Switch (275)</title>
            <para>The Set/Resume switch "pointer" terminal is connected through common circuit (97-GD) to OEM connector
                (263) terminal #2 (GRD). The "set" terminal is an input (circuit 97AB) to the ECM through OEM connector
                (263) input terminal #38. The "resume" terminal is an input (circuit 97AA) to the ECM through OEM
                connector (263) input terminal #3.
            </para>
            <para>With the switch in the "set" position, the ECM sees 0 volts at OEM connector (263) terminal #38 and 5
                volts at terminal #3. In "resume" the ECM sees 5 volts at OEM connector (263) terminal #38 and 0 volts
                at terminal #3. In the set/resume neutral position, the ECM sees 5 volts at both OEM connector (263)
                terminals #3 and #38.

            <para>Service brake switch circuit (97AL) is an input to the ECM through OEM connector (263) terminal #30.
                The ground side of the ON/OFF switch is connected through circuit 97-GB to OEM connector (263) terminal
                #2. With the service brakes released (switch closed), the ECM sees 0 volts at OEM connector (263)
                terminal #30. Applying the brakes opens the switch, and the ECM sees 5 volts at terminal #30.

            <para>Clutch pedal switch circuit (97AH) is an input to the ECM through OEM connector (263) terminal #31.
                The ground side of the clutch pedal switch is grounded through circuit 97-GE to OEM connector (263)
                terminal #2. With the drivers foot off the clutch pedal (switch closed), the ECM sees 0 volts at
                terminal #31. When the driver depresses the clutch pedal, the ECM sees 5 volts at terminal # 31.

            <title>Vehicle Speed Sensor</title>
            <para>The vehicle speed sensor is located at the rear of the transmission. The sensor contains a permanent
                magnet that creates a magnetic field interrupted by the teeth on the speedometer output gear. As the
                rotating speedometer gear teeth repeatedly interrupt the magnetic field, a variable AC voltage is
                generated and transmitted through a 2-wire lead connecting to the Caterpillar Vehicle Speed Buffer
                mounted on top of the transmission. This is a single pole sensor.

        </svcsubproc>
        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Vehicle Speed Buffer (259)</title>
            <para>The Vehicle Speed Buffer is a Caterpillar component installed by International on top of the
                transmission. The Vehicle Speed Buffer connects to Engine Harness 5-pin connector (259) and also
                connects to the Vehicle Speed Sensor with a 2-pin connector. The speed buffer receives the variable AC
                signal from the Vehicle Speed Sensor, processes the signal, then outputs a signal to the ECM and a
                signal to the Speedometer/Tachometer unit.
            </para>
            <step1>
                <para count="1">The vehicle speed buffer sends a buffered and shaped signal from connector (259) on
                    circuit 47D through OEM connector (263) terminal #33 to the ECM. The signal to the ECM is a pulsed
                    DC signal of 0 to 6 volts that is interpreted by the ECM as vehicle speed.
                </para>
            </step1>
            <step1>
                <para count="1">The vehicle speed buffer sends a different type signal from connector (259) through the
                    engine harness on circuits 47J and 47K, through engine/chassis harness connector (129) to the
                    speedometer/tachometer microprocessor board. The signal to the speedometer/ tachometer unit from the
                    speed buffer is a -9.0 volt to +9.0 volt, AC signal.
                </para>
            </step1>
            <para>With the key switch ON, the speed buffer receives 12 volt operating power through engine and cab
                harness circuits 97AC/97L, from 10A P2 fuse. The fuse is located on the component support bracket. The
                speed buffer ground is through engine harness circuit 11-DF/97-GB through OEM connector C263 and J7 CAT
                connector and Caterpillar harness to the engine cylinder head ground bolt.

        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Throttle Position Sensor (253)</title>
            <para>The Throttle Position Sensor (TPS) is an electronic sensor attached to the accelerator pedal assembly.
                The TPS connects to the PEEC cab overlay harness at 3-pin connector (253). The TPS operates on 12V
                ignition voltage (circuit 97L/99E) from P2 fuse when- ever the key switch is in the ON position. The TPS
                is grounded (circuit 99-G) through the cab and engine harness to OEM connector (263) terminal #2
                (ground).
            </para>
            <para>TPS output to the ECM is a constant frequency signal with a pulse width that varies with throttle
                position. This output signal is referred to as either "Duty Cycle" or "Pulse Width Modulated" (PWM)
                signal and is expressed as a percentage of throttle between 0 and 100%. TPS output (circuit 99) goes to
                the ECM through OEM connector (263) terminal #40.
            </para>
            <para>The "pedal mounted" TPS
                <emph type="bold">automatically calibrates to the ECM and does not have an adjustment feature</emph>
                as does the previously used "Can" style remote sensor. If the TPS is not properly calibrated, it must be
                replaced.
            </para>
            <para>The pedal mounted TPS should produce a "Duty Cycle" of 10 to 22% at low idle and 75 to 90% at full
                throttle. The percent duty cycle is translated in the ECM into a throttle position percentage of 3 to
                100%.
            </para>
            <para>The remote mounted TPS is not installed by International, therefore no discussion is made of that
                sensor.
