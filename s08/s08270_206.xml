            <para>When headlight switch (410) is in the park light or headlight position, and trailer lights switch
                (409) is on, trailer tail light relay (464-R9) will be energized. With the relay energized, power is
                applied to circuits 68E and 68B, 15A fuse F8-C, circuits 68C and 58AF, connector (22), and circuit 58AF
                to a splice. From the splice power is supplied to lamp (766) by circuit 58H, lamp (767) by circuit 58J,
                lamp (768) by circuit 58K, lamp (769) by circuit 58L, and lamp (770) by circuit 58M, thus causing the
                lamps to illuminate. A ground path is provided by roof strainer ground (J3), and circuit 58-GB to a
                splice. From the splice lamp (766) is grounded through circuit 58-GH, lamp (767) through circuit 58-GJ,
                lamp (768) through circuit 58-GK, lamp (769) through circuit 58-GL, and lamp (770) through circuit
                58-GM.

            <para>When the headlight switch (410) is in the park light or headlight position, and the trailer lights
                switch (409) is on, the trailer tail light relay (464-R9) will be energized. With the relay energized,
                power is applied to circuits 68E and 68B, 15A fuse F8-C, circuits 68C and 58AF, connector (22), circuit
                58AF, connector (7), and circuit 58AF to connector (775). From connector (775) power is applied to lamp
                (58) by circuit 58A, lamp (59) by circuit 58B, lamp (61) by circuit 58C, lamp (62) by circuit 58D, and
                lamp (66) by circuit 58E, thus causing the lamps to illuminate. Lamp (66) is grounded through circuit
                58-GD to lamp (62). Lamp (62) is grounded through circuit 58-GC to lamp (61). Lamp (61) is grounded
                through circuit 58-GB to lamp (59). Lamp (59) is grounded through circuit 58-GA to lamp (58). Lamp (58)
                is grounded through circuit 58-G to connector (775). A ground path is provided by the right cab ground
                stud (404), circuits 11-GBB, 11-GAN, conn. (81), circuits 11-GAN and 11-GAH, conn. (557), and circuits
                11-GAH and 58-G to conn. (775).
