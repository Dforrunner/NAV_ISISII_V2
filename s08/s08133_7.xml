            <para>The engine control system provides the customer a choice of three programmable engine protection
                systems, or a fourth choice where the customer chooses to turn the protection system off. The standard
                engine has all of the components for any of the three protection systems. The difference is how the ECM
                is programmed. The four customer options are:
