        <title>IDLE SHUTDOWN</title>
        <para>The customer selectable idle shutdown feature shuts down the engine (does not shut down power to the cab)
            after a customer selected (programmed) length of time between 3 and 100 minutes. The timer (an ECM function)
            begins counting when the parking brake is set [which closes the park brake/idle timer switch (328)], the
            engine temperature is above 104&#176;F/40&#176;C, the engine speed is at idle rpm, and the ECM does not see
            any clutch or brake pedal operation. Switch (328) is grounded through circuits 97-GE, 97-GA, connector
            (262), circuits 97-GA, 97-G and 11-G to the battery ground. The switch then applies a ground signal by way
            of circuit 97AV, connector (262) and circuit 97AV to the ECM (341).
        </para>
        <para>If these conditions are present, the ECM counts down the customer selected length of time until 90 seconds
            before the scheduled engine shutdown is to occur. At this time the yellow engine warning light begins to
            flash rapidly. The idle timer can be disabled by depressing the accelerator pedal. This will allow the idle
            timer to be overridden if longer idle time is wanted. The shutdown timing sequence can be re-started by
            releasing and re-applying the parking brake.
        </para>
        <para>If the idle timer shuts the engine down, fueling is stopped, but ignition voltage is still present to the
            ECM on circuit 16D at connector (341).
