        <title>THROTTLE POSITION SENSOR (333)</title>
        <para>The Throttle Position Sensor (TPS) is an electronic accelerator pedal. The pedal acts like a
            potentiometer. A five volt signal is sent from ECM terminal A3 on circuit 99A-5V to the pedal assembly. As
            the pedal position changes, the wiper connected to circuit 99 returns a varying signal to ECM terminal D2.
            The signal on circuit 99 is the input to the ECM which regulates engine speed proportional to the throttle
            pedal position. The TPS is grounded on circuit 99-R to ECM terminal C3.
        </para>
        <para>The TPS is self-calibrating. The ECM monitors the signal from the pedal each time the vehicle is started
            and automatically compensates for wear. If a new pedal is installed, it does not need to be calibrated.
            Additionally, the pedal assembly is not adjustable.
        </para>
        <para>The Prolink EST will also monitor accelerator position in terms of "counts." The use of counts as
            diagnostic information is discussed in
