            <para>All CELECT vehicles have a yellow "Engine Warning" light and a red "Engine Stop" light located in the
                tell-tale lights on the instrument cluster. Every time the key is turned to the ignition position, the
                lights will come on for several seconds as a system self-test and then turn off.
            </para>
            <para>If the warning lights remain on it is an indication that the ECM has detected a problem. The CELECT
                system can show and record certain problems. The problems are shown as fault codes. The fault codes are
                recorded in the ECM.

            <para>A diagnostic check may be performed using the Diagnostic ON/OFF switch and Idle/Diagnostic INC/DEC
                switch. Any error codes will be flashed through the red and yellow warning lights. If no errors are
                found, both lights will stay on while the diagnostics switch is on. Consult the Cummins Operation and
                Maintenance Manual furnished with the vehicle for exact procedures and fault code information.
