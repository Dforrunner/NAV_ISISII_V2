        <para>The cruise control switches are used as idle controls when the vehicle road speed is not present (this is
            a customer selected parameter). Refer to the Operators Manual furnished with the vehicle for cruise control
            operating instructions. Refer to circuit diagram CATERPILLAR C-10 or C-12 - CRUISE CONTROL in CTS-5122W.
        </para>
        <para>The cruise on/off switch is lighted to allow for easy location in the dark. Cruise on/off switch circuit
            97AE is an input to the ECM at connector (1014) terminal 59. The ground side of the on/off switch is
            connected through circuits 97-GH, 97-GA, and 97-G to connector (1014) terminal 5. With the switch on, the
            ECM sees 0 volts at connector (1014) terminal 59. With the switch off, the ECM sees 5 volts at connector
            (1014) terminal 59.
        </para>
        <para>The cruise set/resume switch is lighted to allow for easy location in the dark. Set/resume switch terminal
            5 is connected to the ECM through circuits 97-GD, 97-GA and 97-G to the connector (1014) terminal 5.
            Set/resume switch Set terminal 4 is an input (circuit 97AB) to the ECM through connector (1014) terminal 35.
            Set/resume switch Resume terminal 6 is an input (circuit 97AA) to the ECM through connector (1014) terminal
            44.
        </para>
        <para>With the set/resume switch in the set position, the ECM sees 0 volts at connector (1014) terminal 35 and 5
            volts at terminal 44.
        </para>
        <para>In resume position, the ECM sees 5 volts at connector (1014) terminal 35 and 0 volts at terminal 44.
        </para>
        <para>In the set/resume neutral position, the ECM sees 5 volts at both connector (1014) terminals 35 and 44.
