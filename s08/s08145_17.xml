            <para>This section includes Troubleshooting Charts for International installed circuits and components that
                are part of the Caterpillar electronic engine control system. To begin the troubleshooting process,
                refer to the appropriate Caterpillar Troubleshooting Manuals and follow their directions. If the
                Caterpillar diagnostics indicate that a International circuit is suspect, use the trouble- shooting
                charts in this section for a step- by-step procedure.

            <para>The MPSI Pro-Link 9000 can be used to read fault codes, customer parameters and engine parameters. The
                Pro-Link can also monitor various switches and sensors and perform some testing with the Caterpillar
                cartridge.
