            <title>Exterior Lights</title>
            <para>All fuses and circuit breakers providing exterior lights are supplied with battery voltage through the
                cowl power distribution center (590), fuse F33, and circuit 14F to cab feed connector (14). Power is
                then supplied through (14) and circuit 14F/14A to the cab fuse/relay panel. If all exterior lights are
                not functional, check this portion of the system first. For individual exterior light problems, refer to
                the following light system circuitry operations.

            <title>Back-Up Lights</title>
            <para>When the key switch (63) is moved to the start or ignition position, power is applied through circuit
                breaker F15, circuit 71, connector (2), and circuit 71 [circuit 71, jumper harness connector (304) and a
                black wire with 1652SC] to the back-up light switch (317). When the transmission is placed in reverse,
                the back-up light switch contacts close and power flows through circuit 71A [a white wire, jumper
                harness connector (304) and circuit 71A with 1652SC], connector (2), and circuit 71A to the body builder
                connector (194).

            <title>Headlight System - Headlight Circuitry Without Daytime Running Lights</title>
            <para>When the headlight switch (60) is moved to the headlight on position, and the turn signal lever
                control dimmer switch is in the high beam position, power flows through circuit breaker F1, circuit 50,
                the closed headlight switch contacts, and circuit 51 to the dimmer relay (4J). Power flows through the
                closed contacts of the relay and through circuit 52C to a splice.
            </para>
            <para>From the splice power is supplied through circuit 52 to the front end body builder connector (13) to
                illuminate the high beam headlights. From the splice, power is also applied through circuit 52A to the
                instrument cluster connector (27) and to the high beam indicator. The cluster ground is through circuit
                28-GB/11-GA to cab ground (2G).
            </para>
            <para>When the headlight switch is the headlight on position, power is also supplied through circuit breaker
                F2, circuit 58, the closed headlight switch contacts, and circuit 58B/51C to the dimmer relay coil. When
                the dimmer switch is moved to the low beam position, power flows through the relay coil, circuit 51D,
                and dimmer switch connector (192) to the closed contacts of the dimmer switch. The dimmer switch is
                ground through connector (192) and circuit 51-G/11-GA to cab ground (2G). This energizes the dimmer
                relay.
            </para>
            <para>With the relay energized, power is switched from the high beam circuit 52C to the low beam circuit
                53A. Power then flows through circuit 53A/53 to the front end body builder connector (13) to illuminate
                the low beam headlights.
            </para>
        </svcsubproc>
        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Headlight System - Headlight Circuitry With Daytime Running Lights</title>
            <para>When the headlight switch (60) is moved to the headlight on position, and the turn signal lever
                control dimmer switch is in the high beam position, power flows through circuit breaker F1, circuit 50,
                the closed headlight switch contacts, and circuit 51 to the dimmer relay (4J). Power flows through the
                closed contacts of the relay and through circuit 52C to a splice.
            </para>
            <para>From the splice power is supplied through circuit 52 to the front end body builder connector (13) to
                illuminate the high beam headlights. From the splice, power is also applied through circuit 52A to the
                instrument cluster connector (27) and to the high beam indicator. The cluster ground is through circuit
                28-GB/11-GA to cab ground (2G).
            </para>
            <para>When the headlight switch is in the headlight on position, power is also supplied through circuit
                breaker F2, circuit 58, the closed headlight switch contacts, and circuit 58B/51C to the dimmer relay
                coil. When the dimmer switch is moved to the low beam position, power flows through the relay coil,
                circuit 51D, and dimmer switch connector (192) to the closed contacts of the dimmer switch. The dimmer
                switch is ground through connector (192) and circuit 51-G/11-GA to cab ground (2G). This energizes the
                dimmer relay.
            </para>
            <para>With the relay energized, power is switched from the high beam circuit 52C to the low beam circuit
                53A. Power then flows through circuit 53A/53 to the front end body builder connector (13) to illuminate
                the low beam headlights.
            </para>
            <para>For Daytime Running Lights (DRL), an electronic module is utilized. Power flows through fuse F7 and
                circuit 66A to the DRL connector (15) to power the module. The ground path for the module is connector
                (15) and circuit 66-G/11-GB to cab ground (2G).
            </para>
            <para>When the key switch (63) is moved to the ignition on or accessories position, voltage is applied to
                circuit 12, fuse F17, and circuit 66 to the DRL module. This powers up the DRL module, and allows it to
                monitor the voltage on the low beam headlight circuitry by way of circuit 66C.
            </para>
            <para>Whenever the key switch is on and the headlight switch is off, circuit 66C will not detect voltage in
                the low beam circuitry. This causes the module to provide power to the high beam elements, over circuit
                66E, at about 60% of full power. Whenever the headlights are switched on and high beams are selected,
                the power supplied through the headlight switch will override the 60% power level to a full 100% level.
            </para>

        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Panel Lights and Switch Illumination</title>
            <para>When the headlight switch is in the park lights or headlights on position, power is supplied through
                circuit breaker F2, circuit 58, the closed switch contacts, and circuit 58B/62 to gauge cluster
                connector (28). This supplies the back lighting power for the instrument cluster. Power then flows
                through the cluster, cluster connector (27), and circuit 62A to a splice.
            </para>
            <para>From the splice, power is supplied through circuit 62B to the rear end body builder connector (194).
                Power is also applied to circuit 62C and the headlight switch (60) illumination light. The light is
                grounded through circuit 62-GD/11-GB to cab ground (2G).
            </para>
            <para>With the 1652SC model, power is also applied from the splice through circuit 62E to the cruise control
                switch on/off illumination light (391) and circuit 62F to the cruise control switch set/resume
                illumination light (392), if so equipped. Ground for the cruise switch on/off light is circuit
                62-GA/11-GA and the set/resume switch light is 62-GB/11-GA to cab ground (2G).
            </para>
            <para>With the 1652SC model, power is also supplied from the splice through circuit 62H to the automatic
                transmission shifter light, and through circuit 62J, temperature gauge connector (476), and circuit 62J
                to the transmission temperature gauge. Ground for the shifter light is through its mounting bracket, and
                for the temperature gauge, ground is through circuit 11-GC to a ground stud.
            </para>
        </svcsubproc>
        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Parking and Tail Lights</title>
            <para>When the headlight switch (60) is in the park lights or headlights on position, power is supplied
                through circuit breaker F2, circuit 58, the closed switch contacts, and circuit 58B/58D to rear body
                builder connector (194). From the headlight switch, power is also supplied through circuit 58A to front
                end body builder connector (13). These connectors are provided for use by a body builder to supply power
                to the rear tail lights and parking lights.
            </para>
        </svcsubproc>
        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Stop Light Switch</title>
            <para>Power is applied through circuit breaker F4 and circuit 70 to the stop light switch connector (51).
                When the brake pedal is applied, the closed contacts of the stop light switch supplies power to the body
                builder connector (194) through circuit 70A.
            </para>
            <para>When the brakes are applied, power is also supplied to the ECM (379), pin 43, through circuit 70B/97N,
                31-pin dash connector (3) and circuit 97N. At the same time, power is supplied to the hydraulic brake
                monitor module (49) through circuit 70B/90R. The monitor module compares this signal to a signal it
                receives from the hydraulic brake switch.
