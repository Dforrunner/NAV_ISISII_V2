        <para>Whenever electric welding is done on any part of the vehicle, it is not necessary to disconnect the
            International&#174; electronic modules in the cab such as the Electrical System Controller, Remote Power
            Module and the Instrument Cluster. The welder's ground must be connected as close to the weld as possible.
            If vehicle is equipped with an International Engine, disconnect both the positive (+) and the negative (-)
            battery cables including the
            <emph type="bold">electronic power feeds</emph>
            prior to electric welding. If it is necessary to weld close to an electronic component, it is recommended
            that the component be temporarily removed.
        </para>
        <para>Consult manufacturers instructions for all other electronic modules such as: Allison Transmission, Eaton
            Auto Shift Transmission, Bendix ABS, Wabco ABS, Cummins Engine, Caterpillar Engine, Detroit Diesel Engine.
