            <title>Heated Fuel Filter</title>
            <para>Power is applied from the battery feed stud (J1) to circuit 14R/14L, fuse F32, circuit 19D, connector
                (399) and circuit 19E to the fuel heater relay (431). When the key switch (24) is placed in the ignition
                or start position, power is also applied to circuit 13A, fuse F6, circuit 28/19J, connector (399) and
                circuit 19J/19F to the fuel heater relay (431) coil. The relay is energized through ground circuit 19-G
                to the cab ground stud (2G).
            </para>
            <para>With the relay (431) energized, power flows through its contacts, circuit 19A, connector (399),
                circuit 19A, dash connector (2), circuit 19/23A/19A, fuel filter connector (401), and circuit 19A to the
                fuel filter heater and thermo switch (N/L). The ground path is through the filter housing and its
                mounting bracket. When the temperature is 10&#176;C (50&#176;F) or less, the thermo switch contacts
                close and cause the heater element to activate.

        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Water-In-Fuel Light</title>
            <para>With the key on, power is also supplied through circuit 19J/19H to the water-in-fuel module (432).
                From the module, power is applied through circuit 19C, dash connector (2), circuit 19C, fuel filter
                connector (401), and circuit 19C to the fuel filter water probe (N/L).
            </para>
            <para>The ground path for the water-in-fuel module (432) is not a dedicated circuit. The fuel filter housing
                is grounded through its mounting bracket and whenever water builds up to an unacceptable level in the
                filter, the water completes the circuit between the probe contacts and the housing. This energizes the
                water-in-fuel module.
            </para>
            <para>When the water-in-fuel module becomes energized, power is supplied to circuit 19L and the
                water-in-fuel light (433). This energizes the lamp as power flows through the lamp and circuit 19-GA to
                the cab ground stud (2G).
            </para>
            <para>When the key switch or push button is in the start position, the water-in-fuel module is grounded
                through circuit 19P, a blocking diode (N/L), connector (399) and circuit 19N to the key switch (24)
                ground. This serves as a bulb check to assure the bulb is operational.

        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Fuel Filter Restriction Light</title>
            <para>With the key switch (24) in the ignition position, power is also applied through circuit 19J/19K to
                the fuel filter light (434). From the light, power is applied through circuit 19B, connector (399),
                circuit 19B, dash connector (2) circuit 19B, fuel filter connector (401), and circuit 19B to the fuel
                filter vacuum switch (N/L). When the fuel filter becomes restricted, the fuel filter vacuum switch
                contacts close, completing a ground path and causing the fuel filter light to come on.
