            <title>ATA Data Link and Diagnostic/ Programming Connector</title>
            <para>The 6-pin ATA data link connector (384) supplies power for an Electronic Service Tool (EST) through
                fuse F6 and circuit 97C. Ground for the EST is through 97-GK to cab ground (2G).
            </para>
            <para>The EST is able to communicate with the engine control system through a twisted pair of wire circuits.
                The connector serial data transmission lines are through circuit 98B(+)/98E(+) and circuit 98D(-)/98F(-)
                to the instrument cluster. Communication with the ECM is through circuit 98B(+)/98A(+) and circuit
                98D(-)/98C(-) to the 31-pin dash connector (3). From the dash connector, the communication circuits are
                98A(+) to ECM connector (379) pin 16, and 98C(-) to ECM connector pin 17.
            </para>
            <para>The communication system also includes an ATA interface connector (374) for use with aftermarket
                requirements. The communication link for the interface is through circuits 98B(+)/98H(+) and
                98D(-)/98G(-).

            <title>Electronic Device Powering - 1152SC, 1552SC</title>
            <para>Uninterrupted battery power is supplied to power stud (1DVA) through circuit 14D, 20A maxifuse (413),
                circuit 14C, engine harness connector (411) and circuit 14J to the 22-pin dash connector (2). From (2),
                power is applied to circuit 14J and the power stud.
            </para>
            <para>The ground stud (2DVA) ground path is through circuit 11-GC to the 22-pin dash connector (2). From
                (2), the path is through circuit 11-GC, engine harness connector (409) and circuit 11-GB to the battery
                ground post.
            </para>
        </svcsubproc>
        <svcsubproc>
            <title>ECM Power and Ground</title>
            <para>Power is supplied by the batteries to circuit 14A, a 50A maxifuse (408), circuit 14B, engine harness
                to positive battery cable connector (411), and circuit 14B to the Electronic Control Module (ECM) power
                relay (590B) contacts.
            </para>
            <para>Power is also supplied through fuse F6, circuit 97CT, the 31-pin dash connector (3), and circuit 97CT
                to the ECM power relay coil. From the relay, power is applied to circuit 97AH and pin 25 of the ECM
                (379).
            </para>
            <para>When key switch (63) is moved to the ignition position, power is supplied through fuse F12, circuit
                97CR, the 31-pin dash connector (3), and circuit 97CR to pin 24 of the ECM. This signals the ECM that
                the ignition switch is on and causes the ECM to internally switch pin 25 to ground. This completes the
                circuit for the ECM power relay which energizes the relay. With the relay energized, power is applied
                through the closed contacts to circuit 97CM and a splice. From the splice power is applied to ECM pins
                21, 22 and 41 on circuits 97CL, 97CK, and 97AL respectively.
            </para>
            <para>Grounds for the ECM pins 1, 2, 23, and 42 are through circuits 11-GW, 11-GX, 11-GY and 11-GZ
                respectively, to a splice. From the splice, ground is through circuit 11-G, the engine harness to
                negative battery cable harness connector (409) and circuit 11-GA to the negative battery terminal.
            </para>
        </svcsubproc>
        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Accelerator Position Sensor (APS) and Idle Validation Switch (IVS)</title>
            <para>The engine Electronic Control Module (ECM) determines the position of the accelerator pedal by
                processing the input signals from the Accelerator Position Sensor (APS) and Idle Validation Switch
                (IVS).
            </para>
            <para>The ECM sends a regulated 5 volt signal through the black ECM connector (379), circuit 99C, dash
                connector (3), circuit 99C to a splice, and circuit 99J to the APS/IVS (382). The APS then returns a
                variable voltage signal (depending on pedal position) through connector (382), circuit 99B, connector
                (3), and circuit 99B to the ECM. The APS is grounded through circuit 99A/97W, connector (3), and circuit
                97W/97WB to the ECM signal ground.
            </para>
            <para>The ECM learns the lowest and highest pedal positions by reading and storing the minimum and the
                maximum voltage levels from the APS. In this manner the ECM "auto-calibrates" the system to allow
                maximum pedal sensitivity.
            </para>
            <para>The ECM auto-calibrates as the key is on, but when the key is turned off, these values are lost. When
                the key is turned on again, this process starts over. When the pedal is disconnected (or a new one is
                installed), the pedal does not need to be calibrated, as the calibration happens when the key is turned
                on.
            </para>
            <para>When the key switch (63) is in the on or start position, the Idle Validation Switch (IVS) (382)
                receives 12 volt ignition voltage through circuit breaker F10, and circuit 99E. When the pedal is not in
                the idle position (throttle applied), the IVS sends this 12 volt signal to the ECM over circuit 99D,
                connector (3), and circuit 99D to the ECM (379).
            </para>
            <para>The ECM compares the inputs it receives on circuit 99B and circuit 99D from the APS/IVS to verify when
                the pedal is in the idle position. If the APS signal from circuit 99B indicates throttle is being
                applied, then the ECM expects to see 12 volts at IVS circuit 99D. If the APS signal, circuit 99B,
                indicates throttle is not applied, then the ECM expects to see 0 volts at the IVS circuit 99D. The
                timing process is critical between the APS and the IVS sensors. For this reason, it is very difficult to
                determine if the APS/IVS assembly is working properly using a volt-ohmmeter.
            </para>
        </svcsubproc>
        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Barometric Air Pressure (BAP) Sensor</title>
            <para>The ECM (379) sends a regulated 5 volt signal from ECM (379) through circuit 99C, dash connector (3),
                circuit 99C to a splice, and circuit 97BL to BAP sensor (437). The BAP sensor returns a variable voltage
                signal (represents atmospheric pressure) on circuit 97CD, connector (3) and circuit 97CD to the ECM
                (379). The BAP sensor is grounded by circuit 97Z/97W, connector (3), circuit 97W/97WB to the ECM signal
                ground.
            </para>
        </svcsubproc>
        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Air Temperature Sensor (ATS)</title>
            <para>The ECM (379) sends a regulated 5 volt reference signal through circuit 97AX to the Air Temperature
                Sensor (463). As the temperature changes, the sensor changes resistance and provides the ECM with an air
                temperature signal voltage. The sensor is grounded through circuit 97BU/97WB to the ECM signal ground.
            </para>
        </svcsubproc>
        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Cruise Control/Remote Engine Controls - 1652SC</title>
            <para>Power is supplied to the cruise control On/Off switch (391) through circuit breaker F13 and circuit
                97B. When the switch is in the On position, power flows through the closed switch contacts, circuit
                97CF, dash connector (3) and circuit 97CF to ECM (379). This enables the cruise control Set/Resume
                switch to be operational.
            </para>
            <para>With the cruise control On/Off switch in the On position, power is also applied from the switch to the
                cruise Set/Resume switch (392) through circuit 97CA. Momentarily depressing the Set portion of this
                switch supplies a 12 volt signal to the ECM through circuit 97DH, dash connector (3), and circuit
                97DH/97DJ. This engages the cruise control and causes the ECM to maintain the current engine RPM. If the
                cruise control speed is already set, depressing the switch in the Set position causes the engine RPM to
                decrease until the switch is released.
            </para>
            <para>With the cruise control On/Off switch (391) in the On position, depressing the Resume portion of the
                Set/Resume switch (392) supplies a 12 volt signal to the ECM through circuit 97DE, dash connector (3)
                and circuit 97DE/97DK. If the cruise control speed has not been engaged, momentarily depressing the
                switch causes the ECM to resume the last engine RPM setting.
            </para>
            <para>If the cruise control is already engaged, momentarily depressing the resume portion of the switch will
                cause the engine RPM and speed to increase in small incremental amounts until the desired speed is
                reached.
            </para>
            <para>Engine control circuits are also provided for remote, preset and variable speed switches and a remote
                accelerator pedal for completion by the body builder when remote engine controls are required. When the
                key switch is on, power is supplied through circuit breaker F11, circuit 97K, dash connector (3), and
                circuit 97DF to the body builder switch connections (N/L), located at the cowl power distribution
                center. ECM signal circuits 46A, 46B, 47B, 97AR, 97CC, 97CB, 97DD, 97HM and 99F can also be found at
                this location.

                Information in CT-471 Body Builder Book.
