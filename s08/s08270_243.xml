            <para>A signal path is provided through a green wire, connector (21), circuit 86CA, connector (738), circuit
                86CA, connector (11), circuit 86CA, connector (557), circuit 86CA, connector (122), and the yellow wire
                to the left channel/front bunk speaker volume control. From the volume control the adjusted signal is
                supplied to a green wire, a headphone jack, a green wire, connector (122), circuit 86R, connector (558),
                circuit 86R, connector (13), circuit 86R, connector (10), and the green wire to the front bunk speaker.
