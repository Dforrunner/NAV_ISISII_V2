            <title>Battery Power</title>
            <para>The vehicle batteries are connected in parallel and provide power through the 4/0 positive battery
                cable to the cranking motor solenoid (B) stud.
            </para>
            <para>The negative battery terminals are also connected in parallel and provide a ground path through the
                3/0 negative battery cable to the cranking motor ground stud. The frame, engine block, and cab platform
                are also interconnected by ground cables to the battery ground.
            </para>
            <para>For additional information on the operating principles for batteries, refer to GROUP 08 - ELECTRICAL,
                in the Master Service Manual.

            <title>Cranking System and Circuits - Front Key Start</title>
            <para>With the vehicle in neutral and the instrument panel key switch (20) in the start position, power
                flows from the battery feed stud (1F) through circuit A14D, circuit A19, fuse F16, circuit A15A, and to
                the key switch (20). From the key switch, power flows through circuit A17A, the start interrupt
                connector (195), circuit K17 and dash connector (2). Power is then applied through the chassis harness
                on circuit N17, the chassis harness to engine harness connector (9850), and circuit K17 to the rear
                control box connector (6000). From the control box connector (6000), power flows through circuit V17S to
                the logic side of the crank relay (6309). The relay is grounded through circuit K17S to the control box.
            </para>
            <para>Power is also available at the switch contact end of the time delay crank relay (6309) through the
                start relay (6310) circuitry. With the engine stop switch (6308) contacts closed, power is supplied to
                the ignition relay through circuit K14B-FL/K14B, control box connector (6000), circuit V14B/V14A, engine
                stop switch (6308), and circuit V14D.
            </para>
            <para>With the ignition in the on or start position, power flows through circuit A13/A13A, fuse F19, circuit
                A13K to the rear control box connector (6000). From connector (6000), power flows through circuit V13K
                to the blocking diode assembly (6311), and through circuit V13R to the coil of the ignition relay. The
                relay is grounded through circuit V11-G/11-GH to the (2G) control box ground. This causes the ignition
                relay to energize.
            </para>
            <para>With the transmission in neutral (neutral position switch contacts closed) and the ignition relay
                (6309) energized, power flows through circuit V13S to the rear fuse holder (1C), fuse C1, circuit V97P,
                control box connector (6000) and circuit K97P to the neutral position switch (3120). Power then flows
                through the switch contacts, circuit K17E, connector (6000) and circuit V17E to the time delay crank
                relay (6309).
            </para>
            <para>Voltage is provided from the front key switch (circuit A17A) through circuit K17D to the crank relay
                (6309) coil. If cranking is enabled, a ground path is provided through circuit K17S, control box
                connector (6000), and circuit K17S to the (ECM2) Engine Control Module (6020).
            </para>
            <para>The energized crank relay controls the start relay (6310) by providing power through circuit K17A.
                This energizes the start relay which is grounded through circuit K17D, and circuit K17-G/11-GS to the
                crank motor ground stud (G).
            </para>
            <para>Battery power is always present at the crank motor solenoid (B) terminal through the 4/0 positive
                battery cable. The 3/0 negative battery cable is attached to the crank motor ground stud which is
                grounded to the frame rail. Power is also available at the start relay (6310) through the solenoid (B)
                terminal and circuit K17-FL/K17B. With the starter relay energized, power flows through the closed
                contacts and circuit K17A to the (S) terminal of the crank motor solenoid which energizes the solenoid.
            </para>
            <para>With the crank motor solenoid energized, the solenoid engages the crank motor's shaft to rotate. When
                the engine starts and the key is released, power is removed from circuit K17A which de-energizes the
                start relay (6310) and disengages the crank motor.
            </para>
            <para>If the engine does not start initially, the engine will crank until the key switch is released, the
                crank motor thermal overcrank protection system is activated, or the ECM2 supply voltage drops below 6
                volts. This causes the ECM2 to remove power from the time delay crank relay which allows the starter to
                crank for only an additional 2 second time delay period.
            </para>
        </svcsubproc>
        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Cranking System and Circuits - Rear Key Start</title>
            <para>In order to start the engine from the rear, the rear control box is equipped with an additional key
                switch (6305). Battery power is available from the battery feed stud (1F), through circuit K14B-FL/K14B,
                control box connector (6000), and circuit V14B/V14 to the key switch (6305). When the key switch is
                turned to the on or start position, power flows through the key switch and through circuit V17E to the
                crank relay (6309) and through circuit V13N to the blocking diode assembly (6311). From there, the
                system circuitry is the same as described for the front key start.
            </para>
            <para>For additional information on the operating principles for cranking motors, refer to GROUP 08 -
                ELECTRICAL in the CTS-5000 Master Service Manual.

        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Cranking System and Circuits - Cranking Motor Thermal Overcrank Protection</title>
            <para>With crank motor thermal overcrank protection, the start relay (6310) control coil ground K17D is
                connected to the normally closed thermal overcrank protection switch (N/L) located in the end of the
                cranking motor. The overcrank protection switch is grounded through circuits K17-G/11-GS to the crank
                motor ground stud.
            </para>
            <para>If excessive cranking causes the crank motor temperature to exceed a pre-set temperature limit, the
                thermal overcrank protection switch contacts open and causes the start relay to de-energize and the
                crank motor to disengage. When the crank motor cools, the thermal switch contacts reset and the crank
                motor can be engaged.
            </para>

        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Charging System</title>
            <para>With the engine running, the function of the alternator is to produce direct current (DC) in order to
                supply power to the vehicle electrical system, and to charge the batteries.
            </para>
            <para>When the vehicle is running, the alternator supplies power through the alternator (+) terminal,
                circuit K2, and K2-FL/K2A-FL to the crank motor solenoid (B) stud. From this stud, power is supplied to
                the body builder feed stud (1F) through circuit N14-FL/N14A-FL/N14.
            </para>
            <para>Any current above the needs of the vehicle electrical system is used to supply the batteries. From the
                crank motor solenoid (B) stud, the alternator also charges the batteries through the 4/0 battery cable
                to the battery positive terminal.
            </para>
            <para>The ground path for the alternator is the (-) terminal and circuit K2-G to the crank motor ground
                stud.
            </para>
            <para>For additional information on the operating principles for alternators, refer to GROUP 08 - ELECTRICAL
                in the CTS-5000 Master Service Manual.
