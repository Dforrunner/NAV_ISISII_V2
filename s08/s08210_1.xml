        <para>This service manual section is intended for use by professional technicians, NOT a "
            <emph type="bold">do-it-yourselfer</emph>." It is written to inform these technicians of conditions that may
            occur on some vehicles, or to provide information that could assist in the proper service of a vehicle.
            Properly trained technicians have the equipment, tools, safety instructions, and know-how to do a job
            properly and safely. If a condition is described, DO NOT assume that the service section applies to your
            vehicle. See your International Truck Dealer for information on whether this service section applies to your
            vehicle.
