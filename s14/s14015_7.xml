        <title>GENERAL</title>
        <para>Spicer assembly consists of a full float, cold formed and welded, banjo-type housing member to which the
            differential carrier assembly is bolted. The banjo housing is the vehicle load carrying member, and the
            differential carrier assembly is the torque transmitting portion of the axle. It consists of a primary
            hypoid gear set for high range operation that is combined with a secondary spur gear planetary for low range
            operation. Range changes are easily made by means of a hand control button mounted on the gear shift lever.
            The control button causes the planetary sun gear to act as a sliding clutch member and moves it in and out
            of engagement with two clutching plates to complete range changes.
