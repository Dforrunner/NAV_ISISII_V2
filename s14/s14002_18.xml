            <title>Check for Air Leaks</title>
            <para>A simple method for quickly locating troubles in the system is to listen for possible air leaks and
                for sound which would indicate shift unit operation. Proceed as follows:
            </para>
            <step1>
                <para count="1">Turn ignition switch ON to energize and open solenoid valve. Move shifter knob to HI. In
                    this position, air pressure should be present in the entire system. Check for air leaks.
                </para>
            </step1>
            <step1>
                <para count="1">With shifter knob in LO, air pressure should be present only up to the shifter valve.
                </para>
            </step1>
            <step1>
                <para count="1">To check axle for shifting, operate shifter knob back and forth from LO to HI. If the
                    shift unit is operating, a definite reaction will be evident by the sound of parts movement.
                </para>
            </step1>
            <step1>
                <para count="1">If air pressure is satisfactory and shift unit does not operate, disassemble and inspect
                    shift unit.
                </para>
            </step1>
        </svcsubproc>
        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Check Pressure Switch</title>
            <para>In Low range, the pressure switch is closed. In High range, air pressure opens the pressure switch.
            </para>
            <para>To check pressure switch operation, shift to High range and probe switch terminals. No voltage should
                be present. Replace a faulty pressure switch as an assembly.
            </para>
        </svcsubproc>
        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Check Electrical System (with Solenoid Valve)</title>
            <step1>
                <para count="1">When ignition switch is ON, the solenoid valve is energized and air pressure is
                    available to operate the system. When ignition switch is OFF, the solenoid valve is de-energized and
                    exhausts the system, which downshifts the axle to Low range. Check wiring and circuit breaker for
                    defects that would cause shorts or open circuits.
                </para>
            </step1>
            <step1>
                <para count="1">Make sure the valve has a good ground connection to the frame. With power at the valve,
                    check operatIon as follows:
                </para>
                <para>Disconnect lead wire and air line outlet at the valve and install air pressure gauge.</para>
            </step1>
            <para>Apply power to valve and observe air gauge reading. Operating pressure should be approximate reservoir
                pressure.
            </para>
            <para>If gauge indicates approximate pressure, valve is okay.</para>
            <para>If gauge indicates low or no pressure, valve is faulty. Replace valve assembly.</para>
        </svcsubproc>
        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Check Quick Release Valve</title>
            <para>The quick release valve provides a means of quickly exhausting air from the system when the axle is
                shifted from High to Low range.
            </para>
            <para>To check valve operation, listen for audible air exhaust from the valve when the axle shifts from High
                to Low range. Replace a faulty quick release valve as an assembly.
