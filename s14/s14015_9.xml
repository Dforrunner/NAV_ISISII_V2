        <title>LOW RANGE</title>
        <para>In low range, engine power is transmitted to the hypoid ring gear as before. It then flows to the ring
            gear internal spur teeth, which transfer it to the planet gears that are attached to the differential case.
            Because the sun gear is clutched to a stationary retainer plate, it cannot rotate and acts as a reaction
            member for the planet gears. This causes the planet gears to rotate around the sun gear, driving the
            differential case at a speed slower than the ring gear, creating the additional low range reduction ratio
            and further multiplying engine torque. From this point, power flows in the same sequences as when the axle
            is in high range.
