        <title>YOKE RE-USE GUIDELINES</title>
        <para>The surface of the yoke and lips of the seal form a critical interface which retains the axle's lubricant
            while sealing the axle from outside contaminants. The condition of the yoke hub's surface is a very
            important factor in determining seal life.
        </para>
        <para>Carefully inspect the seal surface area of the yoke hub for signs of wear and damage. Do not reuse the
            yoke if there is noticeable wear, such as heavy grooving, beyond normal polishing from the seal lips.
        </para>
        <specpara>
            <note>
                <para>Do not rework the yoke with abrasives such as emery paper or crocus cloth. Clean the surface of
                    the yoke as necessary using chemical cleaners. Remove all trace of the chemicals from the yoke after
                    cleaning.

            <emph type="bold">Do not use wear sleeves.</emph>
            Wear sleeves increase the yoke hub surface diameter and cause premature seal wear and repeat seal failure.
