        <para>With the system enabled, any lift axle can be independently lowered or raised using its UP/DOWN switch. An
            indicator on the UP/DOWN switch for each axle is lit when that axle is in the down position. The load
            capacity for each lowered axle can be adjusted independently using its pressure regulator. The amount of air
            pressure applied to the load bags of each lift axle is indicated on the pressure gauge(s) for that axle. By
            referencing the load pressure chart for each axle type, the driver can determine
            <emph type="bold">approximately</emph>
            how much air pressure is required to provide the desired load capacity for each lift axle. Refer to

            <note>
                <para>The air pressure values indicated in the Load Pressure Tables are approximate. To obtain an
                    accurate load vs. air pressure reading it is necessary to calibrate the unit over a flat and
                    accurate scale.
