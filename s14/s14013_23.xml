            <para>Drain when the lube is at normal operating temperature. It will run freely and minimize the time
                necessary to fully drain the axle.

            <para>Unscrew the magnetic drain plug on the underside of the axle housing and allow the lube to drain into
                a suitable container.

            <para>Inspect drain plug for large quantities of metal particles. After initial oil change, these are signs
                of damage or extreme wear in the axle. Inspection of the entire unit may be warranted. Clean the drain
                plug and replace it after the lube has drained completely. Inspect breather for clogging or corrosion.
                Clean or replace as necessary.
