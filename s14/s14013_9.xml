                <para>Any damage which affects the alignment or structural integrity of the housing requires housing
                    replacement. Do not repair by welding or straightening. This process can affect the material's
                    properties and cause it to fail completely under load.

            <emph type="bold">Silicone Rubber Gasket Compound:</emph>
            For more effective sealing, Eaton uses silicone rubber gasket compound to seal the majority of
            metal-to-metal mating surfaces. Refer to GROUP 10 - LUBRICATION in the CTS-5000 Master Service Manual for
            recommended gasket compounds.
        </para>
        <para>Eaton includes gasket compound and application instructions in many repair parts kits.</para>
        <para>It is recommended that this compound be used in place of conventional gaskets. The compound will provide a
            more effective seal against lube seepage and is easier to remove from mating surfaces when replacing parts.
