        <title>TANDEM AXLE TIRE MATCHING</title>
        <para>Unmatched tires on Tandem Drive Units will cause tire wear and scuffing and possible damage to the drive
            units. Consequently, we recommend tires be matched to within .125 inch (3 mm) of the same rolling radius and
            .75 inch (19 mm) of the same rolling circumference.
        </para>
        <specpara>
            <note>
                <para>The four largest tires should never be installed on one driving axle or the four smallest tires on
                    the other driving axle. Such tire mounting will cause an inter-axle "fight," unusually high axle
                    lubricant temperatures that result In premature lubricant breakdown, and possible costly axle
                    service.

        <para>Vary tire air pressure, within tire manufacturer's recommended range, so the lubricant temperature of both
            axles is within 30&#176;F (1.1&#176;C) of each other and not in excess of 200&#176;F (93.3&#176;C). This
            will usually result in uniform tire loading and good tire life.
