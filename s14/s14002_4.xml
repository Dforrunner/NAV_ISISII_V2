            <para>When shifting axle range either up or down, the motor starts and turns the worm gear shaft. The gear
                assembly (which is meshed with the worm gear) turns and moves the eccentric pin in the slot area of the
                slider block.
            </para>
            <para>Since driving torque holds the shift fork and swivel block of the slider block assembly in place,
                linear motion of the slider block is translated into compression of the internal spring.
            </para>
            <para>As the motor shuts off at 180&#176; of gear rotation, a break in torque by the driver allows spring
                force (stored in the slider block assembly) to move the swivel pin and shift fork in appropriate
                direction for axle range change.
            </para>
            <para>When opposite axle range is selected by the driver, the process is repeated by the motor turning
                another 180&#176; in the same direction. In this case, though, eccentric pin movement creates block
                spring compression in the opposite direction.
