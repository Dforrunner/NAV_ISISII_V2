        <specpara>
            <warning>
                <para>To avoid property damage, personal injury, or possible death; set all UP/DOWN switches to the UP
                    position before enabling the system (pressing the AXLE ENABLE switch). If any axle UP/DOWN switch is
                    in the DOWN position when the ignition is switched off, the axle controlled by that switch will
                    automatically raise to its up position. Enabling the lift axle system with an axle UP/DOWN switch in
                    the DOWN position will cause that axle to be immediately lowered. The position of the UP/DOWN
                    switches should be checked carefully because the DOWN indicators on the switches are always unlit
                    (in either switch position) until the system is enabled.

                <para>It is good practice to place all axle UP/DOWN switches to the UP position before disabling the
                    system.

        <para>Disable the system by switching the vehicle ignition off. This removes power from the system, turning off
            the indicators on the AXLE ENABLE and axle UP/DOWN switches. When the system is disabled, any axles that
            were left in the down position will automatically raise to the up position. The next time the ignition is
            turned on the lift axle system will remain disabled until the AXLE ENABLE switch is pressed.
