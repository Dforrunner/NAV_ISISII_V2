        <title>LUBRICANT ANALYSIS</title>
        <para>The use of lubricant analysis for the monitoring of physical properties and contamination levels of gear
            oil is recommended. The recommended sampling intervals are 50,000 miles or annually for on-highway, and
            25,000 miles or twice per year for on/off highway and severe service applications.
        </para>
        <para>The most accurate samples are obtained shortly after the axle has been operated, while the oil is still
            warm and mixed. Care should be taken to draw the sample from the center of the sump and to avoid areas close
            to magnetic plugs.
