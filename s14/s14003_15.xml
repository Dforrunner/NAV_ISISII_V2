        <title>OPERATION TEST</title>
        <para>Check to see that both wheels of each NoSPIN differential equipped axle are driving. Make this test under
            load, so that engine torque is applied through the NoSPIN differential with the wheels on the ground. One
            way to achieve this load is to drive up against a solid obstruction (on loose dirt or gravel, if possible)
            and attempt to spin both wheels together. Perform this test in forward and reverse.
        </para>

                <para>Exercise caution when performing this test.</para>
                <para>Do not operate the vehicle if both wheels of a NoSPIN/ Detroit Locker equipped axle are not
                    driving. Power to only one wheel can cause serious steering problems and loss of vehicle control and
                    result in a mishap which can cause property damage, injury, even death.

        <para>Check camming action. On a flat surface, with good traction, drive the vehicle in a tight circle in
            forward and reverse to be sure that the outside wheel is free to overrun (i.e., that the outside tire does
            not scuff). A clicking or indexing sound may be heard. The sound of gear re-engagement may also be heard
            upon completion of the turn. This is normal.
