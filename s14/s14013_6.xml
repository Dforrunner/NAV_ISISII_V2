            <para>At this time only the components of the inter-axle lockout assembly and minor adjustments can be
                serviced separately. Replacement of major components such as gearing or shafting requires replacement of
                the differential carrier assembly.

            <title>CLEANING</title>
            <para>The differential carrier assembly may be steam-cleaned while mounted in the housing as long as all
                openings are tightly plugged. Avoid direct spray on oil seals and breather. Once removed from its
                housing, do not steam-clean differential carrier or any components. Steam-cleaning after removal could
                cause water to be trapped in cored passages, leading to rust, lubricant contamination, and premature
                component wear.

                    <para>Do not use gasoline to clean parts. Gasoline can explode, causing serious physical injury.
