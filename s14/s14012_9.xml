        <title>REPAIR AND REPLACEMENT</title>
        <para>Replace lower-cost parts, such as thrust washers, seals, etc., that protect the axle from premature wear
            and do not add greatly to the cost of your rebuild.
        </para>
        <para>Replace heavily worn but unbroken parts, since the damage done, should they fail, would greatly exceed
            their replacement cost.
        </para>
        <para>Steel parts such as shafts or gears are not repairable. If worn or damaged, they should be replaced, along
            with mating parts as necessary.
        </para>
        <para>Seals and washers should be routinely replaced. Fasteners with self-locking patches may be reused if
            secured with several drops of Loctite #277.
        </para>
        <para>Axle housing repairs are limited to removal of nicks or burrs on machined surfaces or replacement of
            damaged studs.
