        <title>INSPECT</title>
        <para>All axle components should be closely inspected after cleaning to determine which require replacement. For
            more detailed inspection guidelines and failure analysis, refer to Eaton Failure Analysis Service Manual
            EA-20.
        </para>
        <para>Inspect steel parts for notches, visible steps or grooves. Look for scuffing, deformation or discoloration
            related to improper lubrication.
        </para>
        <para>Inspect gear teeth for signs of excessive wear, pitting or cracking along contact lines before reusing.
            Check tooth contact pattern.
        </para>
        <para>Inspect machined surfaces of cast parts for cracks, scoring, and wear. Look for elongation of drilled
            holes, wear on machined surfaces and nicks or burrs in mating surfaces.
        </para>
        <para>Inspect fasteners for rounded heads, bends, cracks or damaged threads.</para>
        <para>The axle housing should be inspected for cracks or leaks, loose studs or cross- threaded holes.</para>
        <specpara>
            <caution>
                <para>Any damage which affects the alignment or structural integrity of the housing requires housing
                    replacement. Repair by welding or straightening should not be attempted. This process can affect the
                    housing metallurgy and cause it to fail completely when under load.
