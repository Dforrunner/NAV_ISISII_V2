        <title>SAFETY PRECAUTIONS</title>
        <para>Proper service and repair of vehicle components is important to the safe and reliable operation of all
            motor vehicles. This applies particularly to driving axles such as the ones described in this manual. The
            procedures recommended and described in this manual are tested, and effective methods for performing service
            operations. Follow each procedure closely, making use of both the text and illustrations. Some of these
            service procedures show the use of certain tools designed specifically for the operation being performed.
            They are shown as a preferred means of performing the operation. It is not practical to anticipate and
            advise the service trade of all possible alternative methods and of all possible hazardous consequences that
            could occur.
