                                    <para>Studies have indicated that exposure to excessive amounts of brake material
                                        dust (whether asbestos or non-asbestos, fiberglass, mineral wool, aramid,
                                        ceramic or carbon) may be a potential cancer-causing health hazard. Even though
                                        the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has not set any limits
                                        on non-asbestos dust exposure, there is some medical opinion that such
                                        non-asbestos fibers can cause cancer as well. Since most automotive friction
                                        materials normally contain a sizeable amount of this material, it is important
                                        that people who handle brake linings be aware of the problem and know the
                                        precautions to be taken.

                                        OSHA recommends that you use cylinders that enclose the brake. These cylinders

                                        open air.

                                        brake drums, backing plates and other brake parts. After using the vacuum,
