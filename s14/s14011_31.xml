                    axle housing if the crack extends into the metal next to the old weld. A housing that has damage in
                    the seam weld or cover weld because of overload conditions can be repaired. A repaired housing must
                    be used in correct applications.

                            cable and weld, the bearing will be damaged because of electricity arcing. Put the ground
                            cable as close as possible to the weld location so that any bearings are not in the path of
                            the current.
